<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>A Ninth Edition of the following Poems having been called for by the
public, the author is induced to say a few words, particularly
concerning those which, under the name of Sonnets, describe his personal
feelings.</p>

<p>They can be considered in no other light than as exhibiting occasional
reflections which naturally arose in his mind, chiefly during various
excursions, undertaken to relieve, at the time, depression of spirits.
They were, therefore, in general, suggested by the scenes before them;
and wherever such scenes appeared to harmonise with his disposition at
the moment, the sentiments were involuntarily prompted.</p>

<p>Numberless poetical trifles of the same kind have occurred to him, when
perhaps, in his solitary rambles, he has been "chewing the cud of sweet
and bitter fancy;" but they have been forgotten as he left the places
which gave rise to them; and the greater part of those originally
committed to the press were written down, for the first time, from
memory.</p>

<p>This is nothing to the public; but it may serve in some measure to
obviate the common remark on melancholy poetry, that it has been very
often gravely composed, when possibly the heart of the writer had very
little share in the distress he chose to describe.</p>

<p>But there is a great difference between <i>natural</i> and <i>fabricated</i>
feelings, even in poetry. To which of these two characters the poems
before the reader belong, the author leaves those who have felt
sensations of sorrow to judge.</p>

<p>They who know him, know the occasions of them to have been real; to the
public he might only mention the sudden death of a deserving young
woman, with whom,</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.</h2>


<p>To account for the variations which may be remarked in this last edition
of my Sonnets, from that which was first published fifty years ago, it
may be proper to state, that to the best of my recollection, they now
appear nearly as they were originally composed in my solitary hours;
when, in youth a wanderer among distant scenes, I sought forgetfulness
of the first disappointment in early affections.</p>

<p>Delicacy even now, though the grave has long closed over the beloved
object, would forbid entering on a detail of the peculiar circumstances
in early life, and the anguish which occasioned these poetical
meditations. In fact, I never thought of writing them down at the time,
and many had escaped my recollection;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but three years after my return
to England, on my way to the banks of Cherwell, where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I bade the pipe farewell, and that sad lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose music, on my melancholy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wooed,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>passing through Bath, I wrote down all I could recollect of these
effusions, most elaborately <i>mending</i> the versification from the natural
flow of music in which they occurred to me, and having thus <i>corrected</i>
and written them out, took them myself to the late Mr Cruttwell, with
the name of "Fourteen Sonnets, written chiefly on Picturesque Spots
during a Journey."</p>

<p>I had three times knocked at this amiable printer's door, whose kind
smile I still recollect; and at last, with much hesitation, ventured to
unfold my message; it was to inquire whether he would give any thing for
"Fourteen Sonnets," to be published with or without the name.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He at
once declined the purchase, and informed me he doubted very much whether
the publication would repay the expense of printing, which would come to
about five pounds. It was at last determined one hundred copies, in
quarto, should be published<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> as a kind of "forlorn hope;" and these
"Fourteen Sonnets" I left to their fate and thought no more of getting
rich by poetry! In fact, I owed the most I ever owed at Oxford, at this
time, namely, seventy pounds;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and knowing my father's large family
and trying circumstances, and those of my poor mother, I shrunk from
asking more money when I left home, and went back with a heavy heart to
Oxford, under the conscious weight, that my poetic scheme failing, I had
no means of paying Parsons, the mercer's, bill! This was the origin of
the publication.</p>

<p>As this plain account is so connected with whatever may be my name in
criticism and poetry, it is hoped it will be pardoned.</p>

<p>All thoughts of succeeding as a poet were now abandoned; but, half a
year afterwards, I received a letter from the printer informing me that
the hundred copies were all sold, adding, that if I had published <span class="smcap">five
hundred</span> copies, he had no doubt they would have been sold also.</p>

<p>This, in my then situation, my father now dead, and my mother a widow
with seven children, and with a materially reduced income (from the loss
of the rectories of Uphill and Brean in Somerset), was gratifying
indeed; all my golden dreams of poetical success were renewed;&mdash;the
number of the sonnets first published was increased, and five hundred
copies, by the congratulating printer, with whose family I have lived in
kindest amity from that hour, were recommended to issue from the press
of the editor of the <i>Bath Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>But this was not all, the five hundred copies were sold to great
advantage, for it was against my will that <i>five hundred</i> copies should
be printed, till the printer told me he would take the risk on himself,
on the usual terms, at that time, of bookseller and author.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, it was agreed that <i>seven hundred and fifty</i> copies
should be printed, in a smaller and elegant size. I had received
Coleridge's warm testimony; but soon after this third edition came out,
my friend, Mr Cruttwell, the printer, wrote a letter saying that two
young gentlemen, strangers, one a particularly handsome and pleasing
youth, lately from Westminster School, and both literary and
intelligent, spoke in high commendation of my volume, and if I recollect
right, expressed a desire to have some poems printed in the same type
and form. Who these young men were I knew not at the time, but the
communication of the circumstance was to me most gratifying; and how
much more gratifying, when, from one of them, after he himself had
achieved the fame of one of the most virtuous and eloquent of the
writers in his generation, I received a first visit at my parsonage in
Wiltshire upwards of forty years afterwards! It was <span class="smcap">Robert Southey</span>. We
parted in my garden last year, when stealing time and sorrow had marked
his still manly, but most interesting countenance.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;Therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I confined myself to fourteen lines, because fourteen lines
seemed best adapted to unity of sentiment. I thought nothing about the
strict Italian model; the verses naturally flowed in unpremeditated
harmony, as my ear directed, but the slightest inspection will prove
they were far from being mere elegiac couplets. The subjects were
chiefly from river scenery, and the reader will recollect what Sir
Humphrey Davy has said on this subject so beautifully; it will be
recollected, also, that they were published ten years before those of Mr
Wordsworth on the river Duddon, Yarrow, <i>et cet.</i> There have been many
claimants, among modern poets, for the laurel of the sonnet, but, in
picturesque description, sentiment, and harmony, I know none superior to
those of my friend the Rev. Charles Hoyle, on scenery in Scotland, the
mountains of Ben Nevis, Loch Lomond, <i>et cet.</i></p></div>

originally with their natural pauses, others for the press I thought it
best to correct into verse less broken, and now, after fifty years, they
are recorrected, and restored, I believe, more nearly to the original
shape in which they were first meditated.</p></div>

<h3>MONODY ON HENRY HEADLEY.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To every gentle Muse in vain allied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In youth's full early morning <span class="smcap">Headley</span> died!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too long had sickness left her pining trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With slow, still touch, on each decaying grace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untimely sorrow marked his thoughtful mien!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair upon his languid smile was seen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Resignation, musing on the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(When now no hope could cheer, no pity save),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Virtue, that scarce felt its fate severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pale Affection, dropping soft a tear                        <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For friends beloved, from whom she soon must part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathed a sad solace on his aching heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ceased he yet to stray, where, winding wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Muse's path his drooping steps beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent to rescue some neglected rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lone-blooming, from the mournful waste of time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cull each scattered sweet, that seemed to smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like flowers upon some long-forsaken pile.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far from the murmuring crowd, unseen, he sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each charm congenial to his saddened thought.                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the gray morn illumed the mountain's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the sweet birds' earliest song he hied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When meekest eve to the fold's distant bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listened, and bade the woods and vales farewell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musing in tearful mood, he oft was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last that lingered on the fading green.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The waving wood high o'er the cliff reclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murmuring waterfall, the winter's wind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His temper's trembling texture seemed to suit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As airs of sadness the responsive lute.                         <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet deem not hence the social spirit dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though from the world's hard gaze his feelings fled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm was his friendship, and his faith sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warm as Pity's his unheeded tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wept the ruthless deed, the poor man's fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fortune's storms left cold and desolate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Farewell! yet be this humble tribute paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all his virtues, from that social shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once we sojourned.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>    I, alas! remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mourn the hours of youth, yet mourn in vain,                 <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fled neglected. Wisely thou hast trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The better path; and that High Meed, which <span class="smcap">God</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ordained for Virtue towering from the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall bless thy labours, spirit pure and just!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For he, who wandered o'er the world alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening to Misery's universal moan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who, sustained by Virtue's arm sublime,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Arose to desolate the sickening land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When many a mingled cry and dying prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resounded to the listening midnight air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When deep dismay heard not the frequent knell,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Calm he was found: the dews of death he dried;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere yet the languid sense was lost in death;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with that look protecting angels wear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The heart that throbbed with pity beats no more.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where'er the just and good thy tale shall hear,                 <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the still dungeon, his long sorrow's tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captive, mourning, o'er his chain shall bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think the cold earth holds his only friend!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Remembering thy last look and anxious eye,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Friend of mankind, farewell! These tears we shed&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So wills thy <span class="smcap">God</span>, and what He wills is best!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou hast encountered dark Disease's train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast conversed with Poverty and Pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast beheld the dreariest forms of woe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So didst thou hush the tempest, stilling wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human woe the loud-lamenting tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor shall the spirit of those deeds expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fades the feeble spark of vital fire,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Relentless Time, that steals with silent tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall tear away the trophies of the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fame, on the pyramid's aspiring top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sighs shall her recording trumpet drop;<br /></span>

<h3>ABBA THULE'S LAMENT FOR HIS SON PRINCE LE BOO.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I climb the highest cliff; I hear the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dashing waves; I gaze intent around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mark the gray cope, and the hollowness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven, and the great sun, that comes to bless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The isles again; but my long-straining eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No speck, no shadow can, far off, descry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I might weep tears of delight, and say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the bark that bore my child away!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sun, that returnest bright, beneath whose eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worlds unknown, and out-stretched waters lie,               <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou behold him now! On some rude shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around whose crags the cheerless billows roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the unwearied surges doth he stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think upon his father's distant land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or has his heart forgot, so far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These native woods, these rocks, and torrents gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall bananas whispering to the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shores, the sound of these encircling seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard from his infant days, and the piled heap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of holy stones, where his forefathers sleep!                    <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, me! till sunk by sorrow, I shall dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them forgetful in the narrow cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never shall time from my fond heart efface<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His image; oft his shadow I shall trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the glimmering waters, when on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white moon wanders through the cloudless sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft in my silent cave, when to its fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the night's rushing tempest we retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall behold his form, his aspect bland;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall retrace his footsteps on the sand;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>                      <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when the hollow-sounding surges swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still think I listen to his echoing shell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would I had perished ere that hapless day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the tall vessel, in its trim array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First rushed upon the sounding surge, and bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My age's comfort from this sheltering shore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw it spread its white wings to the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too soon it left these hills and woods behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing, its course I followed till mine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer could its distant track descry;                       <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till on the confines of the billows hoar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A while it hung, and then was seen no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only the blue hollow cope I spied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long waste of waters tossing wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More mournful then each falling surge I heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dropt the stagnant tear upon my beard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought the wild waves said, amidst their roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At midnight, Thou shalt see thy son no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now thrice twelve moons through the mid heavens have rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a dawn, and slow night, have I told:                   <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still as every weary day goes by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A knot recording on my line I tie;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never more, emerging from the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the stranger's bark approach again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has the fell storm o'erwhelmed him! Has its sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buried the bounding vessel in the deep!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is he cast bleeding on some desert plain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his father did he call in vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have pitiless and bloody tribes defiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cold limbs of my brave, my beauteous child!                 <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! I shall never, never hear his voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spring-time shall return, the isles rejoice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But faint and weary I shall meet the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'mid the cheering sunshine droop forlorn!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The joyous conch sounds in the high wood loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er all the beach now stream the busy crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh breezes stir the waving plantain grove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fisher carols in the winding cove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light canoes along the lucid tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With painted shells and sparkling paddles glide.                <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I linger on the desert rock alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heartless, and cry for thee, my son, my son.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> I find on referring to the narrative of Captain Wilson's
voyage to the Pelew Islands, that the knots were tied at the time of
Prince Le Boo's departure, and that one was untied every moon by the
disconsolate father.
</p><p>
The evening before the "Oroolong" sailed, the King asked Captain Wilson
how long it might be before his return to Pelew; and being told that it
would probably be about thirty moons, or might chance to extend to six
more, Abba Thule drew from his basket a piece of line, and after making
thirty knots on it, a little distance from each other, left a long
space, and then adding six others, carefully put it by.</p></div>

<span class="i0">Smooth went our boat upon the summer seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leaving, for so it seemed, the world behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its sounds of mingled uproar: we, reclined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the sunny deck, heard but the breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That o'er us whispering passed, or idly played<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the lithe flag aloft. A woodland scene<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On either side drew its slope line of green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung the water's shining edge with shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the woods, Netley! thy ruins pale<br /></span>

<span class="i2">So all was calm and sunshine as we went<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cheerily o'er the briny element.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! were this little boat to us the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As thus we wandered far from sounds of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Circled by friends and gentle maidens fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst morning airs the waving pennant curled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweet were life's long voyage, till in peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We gained that haven still, where all things cease!<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Matlock! amid thy hoary-hanging views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy glens that smile sequestered, and thy nooks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yon forsaken crag all dark o'erlooks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more I court the long neglected Muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As erst when by the mossy brink and falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of solitary Wainsbeck, or the side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Clysdale's cliffs, where first her voice she tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I strayed a pensive boy. Since then, the thralls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wait life's upland road have chilled her breast,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much, as much they might, her wing depressed.               <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wan Indolence, resigned, her deadening hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid on her heart, and Fancy her cold wand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped at the frown of fortune; yet once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call her, and once more her converse sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid the still limits of this wild retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I woo;&mdash;if yet delightful as of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart she may revisit, nor deny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soothing aid of some sweet melody!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I hail the rugged scene that bursts around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mark the wreathed roots, the saplings gray,                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bend o'er the dark Derwent's wandering way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mark its stream with peace-persuading sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That steals beneath the fading foliage pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, at the foot of frowning crags upreared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complains like one forsaken and unheard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, it seems to tell the pensive tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spring-time, and the summer days all flown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while sad autumn's voice ev'n now I hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the umbrage of the high-wood moan,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Breathing fresh airs of fragrance and of joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild woods gently wave, the morning sheds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rising radiance on the mountain heads,                      <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Silver the farthest promontory's height:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hushed is the long murmur of the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst silent o'er the slowly-crisping tides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound to some beaming spot, the bark of pleasure glides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! the scenes that smile in light arrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But catch the sense, and then in darkness fade.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We, poor adventurers, of peace bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look back on the green hills that late we left,                 <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or turn, with beating breast and anxious eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some faint hope that glimmering meets our sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Like the lone watch-tower in the storm of night),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the dismal waste are driv'n despairing by!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meantime, amid the landscape cold and mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope, sweet enchanter, sighing drops his lute:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sad decay and mortal change succeeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the silent scene Time, like a giant, speeds!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet the bleak cliffs that lift their heads so high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Around whose beetling crags, with ceaseless coil,              <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still-returning flight, the ravens toil)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heed not the changeful seasons as they fly,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Uprear, and ages past, as in this now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same deep trenches unsubdued have worn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same majestic frown, and looks of lofty scorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So Fortitude, a mailed warrior old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appears; he lifts his scar-intrenched crest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest gathers round his dauntless breast;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The feeble fall around: their sound is past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sun is set, their place no more is known;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rejoicing in his lonely might, defies.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thee, wandering in the deep and craggy dell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sequestered stream, with other thoughts I view:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost in solitude thy course pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou hadst bid life's busy scenes farewell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet making still such music as might cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weary passenger that journeys near.                         <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such are the songs of Peace in Virtue's shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheard of Folly, or the vacant train<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till in the dust together they are laid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not unheard of Him, who sits sublime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the clouds of this tempestuous clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its stir and strife; to whom more grateful rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The humble incense, and the still small voice<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The crosses and the cares that sometimes fret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life's smoothest channel, and each wish prevent<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If fortune smiled not on his early way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he were doomed to mourn a faithless friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here he might rest, and when his hairs were gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold in peace the parting day descend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a hard world his errors scanned severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When late the earth received his mouldering clay,              <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps some loved companion, wandering near,<br /></span>

<h3>THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDMUND BURKE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why mourns the ingenuous Moralist, whose mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Science has stored, and Piety refined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fading Chivalry displays no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pomp and stately tournaments of yore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! when Philosophy and Truth advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scared at their frown, she drops her glittering lance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round her reft castles the pale ivy crawls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sunk and silent are her bannered halls!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As when far off the golden evening sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly sink the fancy-painted vales,                        <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rich pavilions spread in long array;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rolls the enchanter's radiant realm away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So on the sight the parting glories fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gorgeous vision sets in endless shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shall the musing mind for this lament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mourn the wizard's Gothic fabric rent!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he, with Fancy's poor and pensive child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze on his shadowy vales, and prospects wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lingering love, and sighing bid farewell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the dim pictures of his parting spell!                       <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mourns that Philosophy, abstract and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withering should smite life's fancy-flowered mould;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a smiling sympathy depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That graced the sternness of the manly heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor shall the wise and virtuous scan severe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These fair illusions, ev'n to nature dear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now no more proud Chivalry recalls<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though now on high her idle spear is hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Time her mouldering harp has half unstrung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her milder influence shall she still impart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To decorate, but not disguise, the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To nurse the tender sympathies that play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the short sunshine of life's early way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For female worth and meekness to inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homage and love, and temper rude desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor seldom with sweet dreams sad thoughts to cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half beguile affliction of her tear!                        <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whilst whispers bland, and fairest dreams, attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy evening path, till the last shade descend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So may she soothe, with loftier wisdom's aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy musing leisure in the silent shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid poor Fancy, her cold pinions wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life's cloudy skies and beating showers forget.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But can her fairest form, her sweetest song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothe thee, assailed by calumny and wrong!                     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n now thy foes with louder accents cry:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And striven with impious arm to lay her altars low!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No, <span class="smcap">Burke</span>! indignant at the voice we start:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We trust thy liberal views, thy generous heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We think of those who, naked, pale, and poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relieved and blessed, have wandered from thy door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We see thee with unwearied step explore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each track of bloodshed on the farthest shore                   <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of injured Asia, and thy swelling breast<br /></span>

<span class="i2">No, <span class="smcap">Burke</span>! where'er Injustice rears her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er with blood her idol grim is fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er fell Cruelty, at her command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crimson banner marches through the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And striding, like a giant, onward hies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst man, a trodden worm, looks up, and dies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er pale Murder in her train appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With reeking axe, and garments wet with tears;                  <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, lowering Jealousy, unmoved as Fate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon the buried sorrows and the cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him who there, lost and forgotten, lies;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ministers like these, in fearful state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a bloody tyrant's bidding wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou too shalt own (and Justice lift her rod)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause of Freedom is the cause of <span class="smcap">God</span>!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fair spirit, who dost rise in beauteous pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where proud Oppression hath thine arm defied!                   <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>

<h3>ON LEAVING A PLACE OF RESIDENCE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If I could bid thee, pleasant shade, farewell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a sigh, amidst whose circling bowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My stripling prime was passed, and happiest hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead were I to the sympathies that swell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The human breast! These woods, that whispering wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father reared and nursed, now to the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone down; he loved their peaceful shades, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, as here he mused: Live, laurels green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye pines that shade the solitary scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live blooming and rejoice! When I am dead                       <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son shall guard you, and amid your bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like me, find shelter from life's beating showers.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These thoughts, my father, every spot endear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whilst I think, with self-accusing pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger shall possess the loved domain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In each low wind I seem thy voice to hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But these are shadows of the shaping brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now my heart, alas! can ill sustain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must forget&mdash;the world is wide&mdash;the abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of peace may still be found, nor hard the road.                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It boots not, so, to every chance resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er the spot, we bear the unaltered mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, oh! poor cottage, and thou sylvan shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember, ere I left your coverts green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in my youth I mused, in childhood played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gazed, I paused, I dropped a tear unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bitter from the font of memory fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking on him who reared you; now, farewell!<br /></span>

<h3>ON AN UNFORTUNATE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.</h3>

<h4>WRITTEN DECEMBER 1783.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, Mary, when distress and anguish came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slow disease preyed on thy wasted frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every friend, ev'n like thy bloom, was fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Want bowed low thy unsupported head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure sad Humanity a tear might give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Virtue say, Live, beauteous sufferer, live!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But should there one be found, (amidst the few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with compassion thy last pangs might view),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who beheld thy errors with a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the ruins of thy heart were dear,                       <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fondly hoped, the ruthful season past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy faded virtues might revive at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should such be found&mdash;oh! when he saw thee lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closing on every earthly hope thine eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he beheld despair, with rueful trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark the strange features of thy altered face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he beheld, as painful death drew nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy pale, pale cheek, thy feebly lifted eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy chill, shrunk hand, hung down as in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or slowly raised, with many a muttered prayer;&mdash;                <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus, in early youth, he saw thee bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor to the grave, and die without a friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some sadder feelings might unbidden start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more than common pity touch his heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The eventful scene is closed; with pausing dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sorrow I drew nigh the silent bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy look was calm&mdash;thy heart was cold and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the world had never used it ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought the last faint smile, with traces weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still seemed to linger on thy faded cheek.                      <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Mary! though most beauteous in thy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere sorrow touched it, beamed each lovely grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, oh! thy living features never wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look so sweet, so eloquent before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As this, which bids all human passions cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tells my pitying heart you died in peace!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">In wilds, and wastes, and shaggy solitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid his dim hand lead thee through these scenes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burst immense around! By mountains, glens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And solitary cataracts that dash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through dark ravines; and trees, whose wreathed roots<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Heart-stricken, over youth's and beauty's grave,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The cold earth made, which, cast into the vault,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hang o'er the wreathed waterfall, and think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art alone in this dark world and wide!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here Melancholy, on the pale crags laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might muse herself to sleep; or Fancy come,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the white waters, flashing through the cleft,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mingle a pensive moral as she gazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">High o'er thy head, amidst the shivered slate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, a sapling yet, the wild ash bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its dark red berries clustering, as it wished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the clear liquid mirror, ere it fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trace its beauties; o'er the prone cascade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Airy, and light, and elegant, the birch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displays its glossy stem, amidst the gloom                      <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of alders and jagged fern, and evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waves her light pensile foliage, as she wooed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passing gale to whisper flatteries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the adverse bank, withered, and stripped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all its pleasant leaves, a scathed oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs desolate, once sovereign of the scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, proud of its beauty and its strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And branching its broad arms along the glen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, speaks it no remonstrance to the heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems to say: So shall the spoiler come,                     <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">That shall lay low your strength, and give your pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the swift-hurrying stream of age, like mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so severe Experience oft reproves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gay and careless children of the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hear the cold rebuke, and then again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn to their sport, as likes them, and dance on!               <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let them dance; so all their blooming prime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They give not up to vanity, but learn<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Avail them, when the evil days draw nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the brief blossoms of their spring-time fade.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now wind we up the glen, and hear below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dashing torrent, in deep woods concealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now again white-flashing on the view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the huge craggy fragments. Ancient stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That murmurest through the mountain solitudes,                  <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time has been when no eye marked thy course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save His who made the world! Fancy might dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw thee thus bound on from age to age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen of man, whilst awful Nature sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the rent rocks, and said: These haunts be mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Taste has marked thy features; here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touching with tender hand, but injuring not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy beauties; whilst along thy woody verge<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pick its scant food secure:&mdash;and fares it not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n so with you, poor orphans, ye who climb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rugged path of life without a friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over broken crags bear hardly on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pale imploring looks, that seem to say,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Laid in her grave-clothes; and the heart is still,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beat anxiously for you! Oh, yet bear on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who sustains the bleating lamb shall feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And comfort you: meantime the heaven's pure beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That breaks above the sable mountain's brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighting, one after one, the sunless crags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awakes the blissful confidence, that here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in a world where sorrow never comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All shall be well.                                             <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rapid river shooting through the gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its lucid line along; and on its side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bordering pastures green, where the swinked ox<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies dreaming, heedless of the numerous flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, in the transitory sunshine, hum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>                          <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round his broad breast; and further up the cot,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sliding from scenes of dread magnificence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks on your charms reposing; such repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sage may feel, when, filled and half-oppressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vast conceptions, smiling he returns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To life's consoling sympathies, and hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heartfelt tenderness, the bells ring out;                 <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or pipe upon the mountains; or the low<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here, with Macbeth, in the dread cavern hails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weird sisters, and the dismal deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a name; there sees the charmed isle,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wild music, such as earth scarce seems to own,                 <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ariel o'er the slow-subsiding surge<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fancy has followed some nigh-foundered bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a league, in ocean's solitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossed far beyond the Cape of utmost Horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stems the roaring deep; her dreary track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still Fancy follows, and at dead of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hears, with strange thunder, the huge fragments fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crashing, from mountains of high-drifting ice                  <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The yellow harvest nods upon the slope;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the dark and matted moss upshoots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bursting clover, smiling to the sun.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thine too the elegant abode, that smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the rocky scene, and wakes the thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender thought, of all life's charities.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And senseless were my heart, could I look back<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of Spring, along the melancholy tract<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wintry Lapland, dawns; the cataract,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From ice dissolving on the silent side                        <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some white precipice, with paly gleam<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And wakes the tuneless birds, the stagnant brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sleeping lakes! So on my mind's cold night<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With gathering fulness, and collected force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the broad cataract, swell and sweep along!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck by the sounds, what wonder that I laid,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To look on life's severe realities.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I never made (a dream-distempered thing)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Fiction's realm my world; but to cold Truth               <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued the vivid shapings of my youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Save when the drisly woods were murmuring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or some hard crosses had my spirit bowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I have left, unseen, the careless crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought the dark sea roaring, or the steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That braved the storm; or in the forest deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all its gray leaves rustled, wooed the tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the loved lyre, that, in my springtide gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waked me to transport.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Eighteen summers now                     <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rose on my view in loveliness. And thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friend of my muse, in thy death-bed art cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, with the tenderest touches, didst unfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shrinking leaves of Fancy, else unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shelterless: therefore to thee are due<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whate'er their summer sweetness; and I strew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly, such flowerets as on hillocks green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mountain-slope, or hedge-row, yet my hand                   <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">May cull, with many a recollection bland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mingled sorrow, Warton, on thy tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom, if bloom they boast, they owe their bloom!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How sweet the sense of quiet gladness is,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He grasps the deadly tube; his dog, with ears<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The bitter change!), then, with his unheard step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkness shrouded, yet approaching fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, from amidst the sunny flowers, lifts up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His giant dread anatomy, and smites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smites the fair prospect once, whilst every bloom              <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs shrivelled, and a sound of mourning fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lone and blasted valley: but no sound<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The country Kate, with shining morning cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Who, in the tumbril, with her market-gear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Exploding, that shall lay the innocent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feathered tenants of the landscape low.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so the clown, who, heedless whether life<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As now his whip above their matted manes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs tremulous, while the dark and shallow stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashes beneath their fetlock: he, astride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On harness saddle, not a sidelong look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deigns at the breathing landscape, or the maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling behind; the cold and lifeless calf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sole companion: and so mated oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is some sweet maid, whose thrilling heart was formed           <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dearer fellowship. But lift the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hail the abode of rural ease. The man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walks forth, from yonder antique hall, that looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mistress of the scene; its turrets gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the trees, and cheerful smoke is seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if no spectred shape (though most retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spot) there ever wandered, stoled in white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the midnight chambers; but quaint Mab<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tiny revels led, till the rare dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peeped out, and chanticleer his shrill alarm                   <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the window rang, then, with a wink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadowy rout have vanished!<br /></span>
<span class="i30">As the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jocund ascends, how lovely is the view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him who owns the fair domain! The friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his still hours is near, to whom he vowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His truth; her eyes reflect his bliss; his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beats high with joy; his little children play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased, in his pathway; one the scattered flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straggling collects, the other spreads its arms,               <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In speechless blandishment, upon the neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its caressing nurse.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beneath the breeze, that moves, and hardly moves,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To watch the nimble fry, that glancing oft<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who steals through life, untroubled as unseen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distant city, with its crowded spires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dimly shines upon his view, awakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No thought but that of pleasure more composed,                 <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the winds whisper him to sounder sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He leans upon the faithful arm of her<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When life was new: time steals away, yet health<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exercise are his; and in these shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though sometimes he has mourned a proud world's wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He feels an independence that all cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breasts with a carol of content; he hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green leaves of his old paternal trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make music, soothing as they stir: the elm,                    <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poplar with its silvery trunk, that shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green sward of the bank before his porch,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With more endearment to the living smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those his infants, who, when he is dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hear the music of the self-same trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waving, till years roll on, and their gray hairs<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Regardless of the lights that blaze within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look upon the wide and silent sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the shadowy moonbeam sleeps:<br /></span>
<span class="i32">How still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heard to murmur, or to move, it lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining in Fancy's eye, like the soft gleam,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Holds her illustrious course through the mid heavens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i27">How different is the scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lies beneath this arched window's height!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town, that murmured through the busy day,                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hushed; the roofs one solemn breadth of shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veils; but the towers, and taper spires above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pinnets, and the gray embattled walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And masts that throng around the southern pier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine all distinct in light; and mark, remote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er yonder elms, St Mary's modest fane.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! if such views may please, to me they shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How more attractive! but few years have passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since there I saw youth, health, and happiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All circling round an aged sire,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> whose hairs                <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>

<span class="i27">That scene is passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold death and separation have dissolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening circle of once-happy friends!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So has it ever fared, and so must fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all! I see the moonlight watery tract                      <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shines far off, beneath the forest-shades:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Holds its inevitable course, the tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of years departing; to the distant eye<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thine eyes have rolled in darkness; want and cares<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Have been thy visitants from morn to morn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">God and the grave are thy best refuge left.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Then Fancy beckoned, and with smiling mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A radiant form arose, like the fair Queen                      <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Beauty: from her eye divinely bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A richer lustre shot, a more attractive light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said: With fairer tints I can adorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living landscape, fairer than the morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summer clouds in shapes romantic rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those they edge the fading west, like gold;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With shades more sweet than real on its breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid baffling stones, beneath a partial ray,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The blue far distant hills, the silvery sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every scene of summer speaks of me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most I wake the sweetest wishes warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the fond gaze is turned on woman's breathing form.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A mellow light through the dim covert strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opening roses canopied the shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why does the hurrying pulse unbidden leap!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, in yonder glade that nymph asleep!                     <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart-struck minstrel hangs, with lingering gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er every charm his eye impassioned strays!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An edge of white is seen, and scarcely seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soft she breathes, her coral lips between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lambent ray steals from her half-closed eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her breast heaves a short imperfect sigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep, winds of summer, o'er the leafy bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor move the light bells of the nodding flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest but a sound of stirring leaves might seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break the charm of her delicious dream!                     <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye, fond, rising, throbbing thoughts, away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest syren Pleasure all the soul betray!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! turn, and listen to the ditty<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the lowly cave of Pity.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On slaughter's plain, while Valour grieves,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">There he sunk to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the ring-dove scattered leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Upon his bleeding breast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face was hid, while her pale arms enfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What seemed an urn of alabaster cold;                          <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this she pressed her heaving bosom bare:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The drops that gathered in the dank abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell dripping, on her long dishevelled hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And still her tears, renewed, and silent, flowed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the winds of autumn ceased to swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times was heard a slow and melancholy knell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas in the twilight of the deepest wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath whose boughs like sad Cocytus, famed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A river dark and silent flowed, there stood                    <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pale and melancholy man, intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His look upon that drowsy stream he bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever counting, when the fitful breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With strange and hollow sound sung through the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counting the sallow leaves, that down the current went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw them not:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth seemed to him one universal blot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes, as most distempered, to and fro<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He paced; and sometimes fixed his chilling look<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon a dreadful book,                                        <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">While gibbering imps, as mocking him, appeared,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Fancy waved her wand again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all that valley that so lovely smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was changed to a bare champaign, waste and wild.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What pale and phantom-horseman rides amain?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis Terror;&mdash;all the plain, far on, is spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With skulls and bones, and relics of the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his black trump he blew a louder blast,                   <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earthquakes muttered as the giant passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then said that magic maid, with aspect bland,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">'Tis thine his sable trumpet to command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrill the inmost heart with shuddering fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But hark! to Music's softer sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New scenes and fairer views accordant rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Above, around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mingled measure swells in air, and dies.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The upland breeze, the comfortable sun,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the landscape's hues! Upon the point<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In charity and peace may wait its close.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet still be with me, O delightful friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothing companion of my vacant hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, still be with me, Spirit of the Muse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to subdue, or hold in moody spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The erring senses, but to animate<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With Nature's fairest views; not to display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain ostentations of a poet's art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But silent, and associate of my joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sorrows, to infuse a tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thought, that seems to mingle, as I gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the works of <span class="smcap">God</span>. So cheer my path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From youth to sober manhood, till the light<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When all my days are gone; let me not pass,<br /></span>

<h2>THE SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY BY SEA:</h2>

<h3>A DESCRIPTIVE AND HISTORICAL POEM.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></h3>



<hr />
<h2>INTRODUCTION.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></h2>


<p>I need not perhaps inform the reader, that I had before written a Canto
on the subject of this poem; but I was dissatisfied with the metre, and
felt the necessity of some connecting idea that might give it a degree
of unity and coherence.</p>

<p>This difficulty I considered as almost inseparable from the subject; I
therefore relinquished the design of making an extended poem on events,
which, though highly interesting and poetical, were too unconnected with
each other to unite properly in one regular whole. But on being kindly
permitted to peruse the sheets of Mr Clarke's valuable work on the
<i>History of Navigation</i>, I conceived (without supposing <i>historically</i>
with him that all ideas of navigation were derived from the ark of Noah)
that I might adopt the circumstance <i>poetically</i>, as capable of
furnishing an unity of design; besides which, it had the advantage of
giving a more serious cast and character to the whole.</p>

<p>To obviate such objections as might be made by those who, from an
inattentive survey, might imagine there was any carelessness of
arrangement, I shall lay before the reader a general analysis of the
several books; and, I trust, he will readily perceive a leading
principle, on which the poem begins, proceeds, and ends.</p>

<p>I feel almost a necessity for doing this in <i>justice</i> to myself, as some
compositions have been certainly misunderstood, where the <i>connexion</i>
might, by the least attention, have been perceived. In going over part
of the same ground which I had taken before, I could not always avoid
the use of similar expressions.</p>

<p>I trust I need not apologise for having, in some instances, departed
from strict historical facts. It is not true that Camoens sailed with De
Gama, though, from the authority of Voltaire, it has been sometimes
supposed that he did. There are other circumstances for which I may have
less reason to expect pardon. The Egyptians were never, or but for a
short time, a maritime nation. In answer to this, I must say, that
<i>history</i> and <i>poetry</i> are two things; and though the poet has no right
to <i>contradict</i> the historian, yet, if he find two opinions upon points
of history, he may certainly take that which is most susceptible of
poetical ornament; particularly if it have sufficient plausibility, and
the sanction of respectable names.</p>

<p>In deducing the first maritime attempts from <i>Thebes</i>, so called from
<i>Thebaoth</i>, the <i>Ark</i>, founded by the sons of Cush, who first inhabited
the caves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> on the granite mountains of Ethiopia, I have followed the
idea of Bruce, which has many testimonies, particularly that of
Herodotus, in its favour. In making the ships of Ammon first pass the
straits of Babelmandel, and sail to Ophir, I have the authority of Sir
Isaac Newton. But still these points must, from their nature, be
obscure; the poet, however, has a right to build upon them, whilst what
he advances is not in <i>direct contradiction</i> to all historical admitted
facts. He may take what is <i>shadowy</i>, if it be <i>plausible</i>, poetical,
and coherent with his general plan. Having said ingenuously thus much, I
hope I shall not be severely accused for having admitted, <i>en passant</i>,
some ideas (which may be thought visionary) in the notes, respecting the
allusion to the ark in Theocritus, the situation of Ophir, the temple of
Solomon, and the algum-tree.</p>

<p>I must also submit to the candour of the critic, the necessity I
sometimes felt myself under of varying the verse, and admitting, when
the subject seemed particularly to require it, a break into the measure.
He will consider, as this poem is neither didactic, nor epic, that might
lead on the mind by diversity of characters, and of prospects; it was
therefore necessary (at least I thought myself at liberty so to do) to
break the uniformity of the subject by digression, contrast, occasional
change of verse, <i>et cet.</i> But after all, at a time so unfavourable to
long poems, I doubt whether the reader will have patience to accompany
me to the end of my <i>circumnavigation</i>. If he do, and if this much
larger poetical work than I have ever attempted should be as favourably
received as what I have before published has been, I shall sincerely
rejoice.</p>

<p>At all events, in an age which I think has produced genuine poetry, if I
cannot say "<i>Ed Io, anchi, sono pittore</i>;" it will be a consolation to
me to reflect, that I have no otherwise courted the muse, than as the
consoler of sorrow, the painter of scenes romantic and interesting, the
handmaid of good sense, unadulterated feelings, and religious hope.</p>

<p>It was at first intended that the poem should consist of six books; one
book being assigned to De Gama, and another to Columbus. These have been
compressed. I was the more inclined to this course, as the great subject
of the <span class="smcap">Discovery of America</span> is in the hands of such poets as Mr Southey
and Mr Rogers.</p>

<h2>ANALYSIS.</h2>

<h3>BOOK THE FIRST.</h3>


<p>The book opens with the resting of the Ark on the mountains of the great
Indian Caucasus, considered by many authors as Ararat: the present state
of the <i>inhabited</i> world, contrasted with its melancholy appearance
immediately after the flood. The poem returns to the situation of our
forefathers on leaving the ark; beautiful evening described. The Angel
of Destruction appears to Noah in a dream, and informs him that although
he and his family alone have escaped, the <span class="smcap">very Ark</span>, which was the means
of his present preservation, shall be the cause of the future triumph of
Destruction.</p>

<p>In his dream, the evils in consequence of the discovery of America, the
slave-trade, <i>et cet.</i>, are set before him. Noah, waking from disturbed
sleep, ascends the summit of Caucasus. An angel appears to him; tells
him that the revelations in his dream were <span class="smcap">permitted by the Almighty</span>;
that he is commissioned to explain everything; he presents to his view
the <i>shadow of the world</i> as it exists; regions are pointed out; the
dispersion of mankind; the rise of superstition; the birth of a <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>,
and the triumph of Charity: that navigation shall be the means of
extending the knowledge of <span class="smcap">God</span> over the globe; and though some evils
must take place, happiness and love shall finally prevail upon the
earth.</p>


<h3>BOOK THE SECOND</h3>

<p>Commences with an ardent wish, that as our forefather viewed the world
clearly displayed before him in a vision, so we of these late days might
be able, through the clouds of time, to look back upon the early ages of
the globe; we might then see, in their splendour, Thebes, Edom, <i>et
cet.</i>; but the early history of mankind is obscure, the only certain
light is from the sacred writings. By these we are informed of the
<i>dispersion</i> of earth's first inhabitants, after the flood. The
descendants of <span class="smcap">Ham</span>, after this dispersion, according to Bruce, having
first gained the summits of the Ethiopian mountains, there form
subterraneous abodes. In process of time they descend, people Egypt,
build Thebes; obscure tradition of the Ark; first make voyages.</p>

<p>Ophir is not long afterwards discovered. This Bruce places, on most
respectable authority, at Sofala; I have ventured to place it
otherwhere, but still admitting one general idea, that when the way to
it overland was attended with difficulties, an easier course was at last
opened by sea. As to Ammon's exploits, I must shelter myself under the
authority of Sir Isaac Newton. After a sacrifice by the Egyptians, the
monsoon sets in. The ships follow its direction, as the mariners imagine
a god leads them. Hence the discovery of so much of the world by <i>sea</i>.
Reflection on commerce. The voyage of Solomon. A description of the
glory of <span class="smcap">Tyre</span>, the most commercial mart of the early world. Tyrian
discoveries in the Mediterranean; voyages to the coast of Italy and
Spain, to the Straits, and from thence to Britain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Tyre is destroyed, and the thought naturally arises, that Britain,
which, at the time of the splendour of the <i>maritime Tyrians</i>, was an
obscure island, is now at the summit of maritime renown; while <span class="smcap">Tyre</span> is a
place where only "the fisherman dries his net." This leads to an
<span class="smcap">eulogium on England</span>; and the book concludes with the triumphs of her
fleets and armies on that very shore, on which science, and art, and
commerce, and <span class="smcap">maritime renown</span>, first arose.</p>

<p>This digression, introducing the siege of Acre, appeared to the author
not only natural, but in some measure necessary to break the uniformity
of the subject.</p>


<h3>BOOK THE THIRD</h3>

<p>Commences with the feelings excited by the conclusion of the last, by a
warm wish that England may for ages retain her present elevated rank.
This leads to the consideration of her <span class="smcap">naval opulence</span>, which carries us
back to the subject we had left&mdash;<span class="smcap">the fate of Tyre</span>.</p>

<p>The history of the empires succeeding Tyre is touched on: the fall of
her destroyer, Babylon; the succession of Cyrus; the character of Cyrus,
and his want of enlarged policy, having so many means of encouraging
commerce; and his ill-fated expedition to the East Indies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander the Great</span> first conceives the idea of establishing a vast
<span class="smcap">maritime empire</span>: in his march of conquest, he proceeds to the last river
of the Punjab, the Hyphasis, which descends into the Indus, the sources
of which are near the mountains of <span class="smcap">Caucasus, where the ark rested</span>.</p>

<p>The Indian account of the Deluge, it is well known, resembles most
wonderfully the history of Moses. When Alexander can proceed no further,
poetical fiction introduces the person of a Brahmin, who relates the
history of the Deluge: viz., that <i>one sacred man was</i>, in this part of
the world, <i>miraculously preserved by an ark</i>; the further march of the
conqueror towards the holy spot is deprecated: his best glory shall be
derived from the sea, and from uniting either world in commerce.
Alexander is animated with the idea; and his fleet, under Nearchus,
proceeds down the Indus to the sea. This forms a middle, connected with
the account of the Deluge, book first.</p>


<h3>BOOK THE FOURTH.</h3>

<p>Nearchus' voyage being accomplished, and Alexandria now complete,
Commerce is represented as standing on the Pharos, and calling to all
nations. The tide of commerce would have flowed still in the track
pointed out by the sagacity of Alexander, but that a wider scene, beyond
<span class="smcap">the ancient world</span>, opens to the <span class="smcap">view of Discovery</span>. The use of the magnet
is discovered; and Henry of Portugal prosecutes the plan of opening a
passage along the coast of Africa to the East. One of his ships on its
return from the expedition has been driven from Cape Bojador (the
formidable boundary of Portuguese research) by a storm at sea. The isle
afterwards called Porto Santo is discovered. The circumstance related;
but the extraordinary appearance of a supernatural shade over the waters
at a distance excites many fears and superstitions. The attempt,
however, to penetrate the mystery, is resolved on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> Zarco reaches the
island of Madeira; tomb found; which introduces the episode. At the tomb
of the first discoverer (whether this be fanciful or not, is nothing to
poetry) the Spirit of Discovery casts her eyes over the globe; she
pursues De Gama to the East; history of Camoens touched on; Columbus;
sees with triumph the discovery of a new world, and from thence extends
her ideas till the great globe is encompassed; after which she returns
to the "tranquil bosom of the Thames," with Drake, the first
circumnavigator, whose ship, after its various perils, being laid up in
that river, gives rise to some brief concluding reflections.</p>


<h3>BOOK THE FIFTH.</h3>

<p>Hitherto we have described only the triumphs of Discovery; but it
appears necessary that many incidental evils, special and general,
should be mentioned. Fate and miserable end of some great
commanders,&mdash;of our gallant and benevolent countryman, Cook. After the
natural feelings of regret, the mind is led to contemplate the great
advantages of his voyages: the health of seamen; the accessions to
geographical knowledge; the spirit of humanity and science; his
exploring the east part of New-Holland; and being the first to determine
the proximity of America to Asia. This circumstance leads us back from
the point whence we set out&mdash;<span class="smcap">the ark of Noah</span>; and hence we are partly
enabled to solve, what has been for so many ages unknown, the
<ins class="correction" title="Original was diffculty">difficulty</ins> respecting the earth's being peopled from one family.</p>

<p>The poem having thus gained a middle and end, the conclusion of the
whole is, that as this uncertainty in the physical world has been by
<span class="smcap">Discovery</span> cleared up, so all the apparent contradictions in the moral
world shall be reconciled. We have yet many existing evils to deplore;
but when the <span class="smcap">Supreme Disposer</span>'s plan shall have been completed, then the
earth, which has been explored and enlightened by discovery and
knowledge, shall be destroyed; but the <span class="smcap">mind of man</span>, rendered at last
perfect, shall endure through all ages, and "justify His ways from whom
it sprung."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Such is the outline and plan of the following poem. I have felt myself
obliged to give this hasty analysis, thinking that self-defence almost
required it, lest a <i>careless</i> reader might charge me with <i>carelessness
of arrangement</i>.</p>

<p>I must again beg it to be remembered, that History and Poetry are two
things; and that the poet has a right to build his system, not on what
is exact truth, but on what is, at least, plausible; what will form, in
the clearest manner, a <span class="smcap">whole</span>; and what is most susceptible of poetical
ornament.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">And Nature listens to the breath of Life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fleet horse bounds, high-neighing to the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lifts his streaming mane; the heifer lows;<br /></span>

<span class="i28">From one spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone of earth such sounds ascend. How changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The human prospect! when from realm to realm,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fervent and glancing on the friths and sounds;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Frowning; some in the southern solitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound on discovery of new regions, spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid rocks of driving ice, that crash around,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The tender social tie; connecting man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever scattered, with his fellow-man.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How many ages rolled away ere thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From <span class="smcap">Nature's general wreck</span>, the world's great scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was tenanted! See from their sad abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Heaven's dread voice, heard from the solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the dayspring of created things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad survivors of a buried world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come forth; on them, though desolate their seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky looks down with smiles; for the broad sun,             <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to the west slopes his untired career,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs o'er the water's brim. The aged sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rising from his evening sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid his offspring stands, and lifts his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moist with a tear, to the bright bow: the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet on the altar burns, whose trailing fume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes slowly up, and marks the lucid cope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the soft sky, where distant clouds hang still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beautiful. So placid Evening steals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the lurid storm, like a sweet form                       <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fairy following a perturbed shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of giant terror, that in darkness strode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow sinks the lord of day; the clustering clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More ardent burn; confusion of rich hues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crimson, and gold, and purple, bright, inlay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their varied edges; till before the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As their last lustre fades, small silver stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succeed; and twinkling each in its own sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick as the frost's unnumbered spangles, strew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slowly-paling heavens. Tired Nature seems                  <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one who, struggling long for life, had beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The billows, and scarce gained a desert crag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-spent, to sink to rest: the tranquil airs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whisper repose. Now sunk in sleep reclines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Father of the world; then the sole moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mounts high in shadowy beauty; every cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retires, as in the blue space she moves on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the fulgent orbs supreme, and looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen of heaven and earth. Stilly the streams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retiring sound; midnight's high hollow vault                   <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint echoes; stilly sound the distant streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When, hark! a strange and mingled wail, and cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of ten thousand thousand perishing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A phantom, 'mid the shadows of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the holy Patriarch, as he slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood terrible:&mdash;Dark as a storm it stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thunder and of winds, like hollow seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remote; meantime a voice was heard: Behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noah, the foe of thy weak race! my name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction, whom thy sons in yonder plains                    <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Paint fabling: when the flood from off the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before it swept the living multitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rode amid the hurricane; I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The universal shriek of all that lived.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain they climbed the rocky heights: I struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The adamantine mountains, and like dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They crumbled in the billowy foam. My hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the centre of the seas, received<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victims as they sank! Then, with dark joy,                 <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat amid ten thousand carcases,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That weltered at my feet! But <span class="smcap">thou</span> and <span class="smcap">thine</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have braved my utmost fury: what remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vengeance, vengeance on thy hated race;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be that sheltering shrine the instrument!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence, taught to stem the wild sea when it roars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after-times to lands remote, where roamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The naked man and his wan progeny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, more instructed in the fatal use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of arts and arms, shall ply their way; and thou                <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst bid the great deep cover thee to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sorrows of thy miserable sons:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But turn, and view in part the truths I speak.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said, and vanished with a dismal sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lamentation from his grisly troop.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then saw the just man in his dream what seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new and savage land: huge forests stretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their world of wood, shading like night the banks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of torrent-foaming rivers, many a league<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering and lost in solitudes; green isles                   <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here shone, and scattered huts beneath the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of branching palms were seen; whilst in the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A naked infant playing, stretched his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach a speckled snake, that through the leaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft darted, or its shining volumes rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erratic.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">From the woods a sable man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came, as from hunting; in his arms he took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smiling child, that with the feathers played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which nodded on his brow; the sheltering hut                   <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received them, and the cheerful smoke went up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the silent woods.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Anon was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound as of strange thunder, from the mouths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hollow engines, as, with white sails spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall vessels, hulled like the great Ark, approached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The verdant shores: they, in a woody cove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe-stationed, hang their pennants motionless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the palms. Meantime, with shouts and song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boat rows hurrying to the land; nor long                   <span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the great sea for many a league is tinged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While corpse on corpse, down the red torrent rolled,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floats, and the inmost forests murmur&mdash;Blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now vast savannahs meet the view, where high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the arid grass the serpent lifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tawny crest:&mdash;Not far a vessel rides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the sunny main, and to the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black savage tribes a mournful captive urge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who looks to heaven with anguish. Him they cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound in the rank hold of the prison-ship,                     <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a sad associate in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each panting chained to his allotted space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moaning, whilst their wasted eye-balls roll.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another scene appears: the naked slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writhes to the bloody lash; but more to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature forbad, for starting from his dream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The just Man woke. Shuddering he gazed around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the earliest beam of morning shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slant on the hills without; he heard the breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of placid kine, but troubled thoughts and sad                  <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose. He wandered forth; and now far on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By heavy musings led, reached a ravine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most mild amid the tempest-riven rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through whose dark pass he saw the flood remote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray-spreading, while the mists of morn went up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He paused; when on his lonely pathway flashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light, and sounds as of approaching wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant were heard. A radiant form appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Celestial, and with heavenly accent said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noah, I come commissioned from above,                          <span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hung o'er thee slumbering: Mine the task to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Futurity's faint scene;&mdash;now follow me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said; and up to the unclouded height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that great Eastern mountain,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> that surveys<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Angel touched, and cleared with whispered charm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of years departed! We might then behold<br /></span>

<h3>BOOK THE THIRD.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My heart has sighed in secret, when I thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the dark tide of time might one day close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">England, o'er thee, as long since it has closed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Egypt and on Tyre: that ages hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Pacific's billowy loneliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose tract thy daring search revealed, some isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might rise in green-haired beauty eminent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a goddess, glittering from the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter sway the sceptre of domain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From pole to pole; and such as now thou art,                    <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps <span class="smcap">New-Holland</span> be. For who shall say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the <span class="smcap">Omnipotent Eternal One</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made the world, hath purposed! Thoughts like these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though visionary, rise; and sometimes move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment's sadness, when I think of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My country, of thy greatness, and thy name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the nations; and thy character,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though some few spots be on thy flowing robe,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of loveliest beauty: I have never passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through thy green hamlets on a summer's morn,                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heard thy sweet bells ring, nor seen the youths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiling maidens of thy villages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gay in their Sunday tire, but I have said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With passing tenderness&mdash;Live, happy land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the poor peasant feels his shed, though small,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">An independence and a pride, that fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His honest heart with joy&mdash;joy such as they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who crowd the mart of men may never feel!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such, England, is thy boast. When I have heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roar of ocean bursting 'round thy rocks,                    <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seen a thousand thronging masts aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far as the eye could reach, from every port<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every nation, streaming with their flags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the still mirror of the conscious Thames,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I have felt a proud emotion swell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I was British-born; that I had lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A witness of thy glory, my most loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honoured country; and a silent prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would rise to Heaven, that Fame and Peace, and Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Liberty, might walk thy vales, and sing                     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their holy hymns, while thy brave arm repelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hostility, even as thy guardian cliffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repel the dash of that dread element<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which calls me, lingering on the banks of Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to my destined voyage, by the shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Asia, and the wreck of cities old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet we burst into the wilder deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Gama; or the huge Atlantic waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bold Columbus stem; or view the bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of field-ice, stretching to the southern pole,                  <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thee, benevolent, lamented Cook!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyre be no more! said the <span class="smcap">Almighty</span> voice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou too, Monarch of the world,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> whose arm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of cities, throned upon her subject seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Art thou too fall'n</span>?<br /></span>
<span class="i21">The whole earth is at rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They break forth into singing:" Lebanon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waves all his hoary pines, and seems to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No feller now comes here; <span class="smcap">Hell</span> from beneath            <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is moved to meet thy coming; it stirs up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">dead</span> for thee; the <span class="smcap">chief ones</span> of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyre and the nations, they all speak and say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou become like us! Thy pomp brought down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en to the dust! The noise of viols ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worm spread under thee, the crawling worm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cover thee! How art thou fall'n from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of the morning! In thy heart thou saidst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will ascend to Heaven; I will exalt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My throne above the stars of God! Die&mdash;die,                     <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blasphemer! As a carcase under foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defiled and trodden, so be thou cast out!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">she</span>, the great, the guilty Babel&mdash;<span class="smcap">she</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who smote the wasted cities, and the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made as a wilderness&mdash;<span class="smcap">she</span>, in her turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks to the gulf oblivious at the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of <span class="smcap">Him</span> who sits in judgment on her crimes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, o'er her palaces and buried towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall bid the owl hoot, and the bittern scream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her pensile groves and pleasant shades                   <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour the deep waters of forgetfulness.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On that same night, when with a cry she fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Like her own mighty idol dashed to earth,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a strange eclipse, and long laments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were heard, and muttering thunders o'er the towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the high palace where his wassail loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belshazzar kept, mocking the <span class="smcap">God of heaven</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flushed with impious mirth; for <span class="smcap">Bel</span> had left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sullen shriek his golden shrine, and sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a gloomy apparition girt,                             <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Nisroch</span> and <span class="smcap">Nebo</span> chief, in the dim sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mooned <span class="smcap">Astoreth</span>, whose orb now rolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkness:&mdash;They their earthly empire mourned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the host of Cyrus through the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent advanced more nigh; and at that hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the torch-blazing hall of revelry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fingers of a shadowy hand distinct<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came forth, and unknown figures marked the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Searing the eye-balls of the starting king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyre is avenged; Babel is fall'n, is fall'n!                   <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bel and her gods are shattered!<br /></span>
<span class="i30"><span class="smcap">Prince</span>, to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called by the voice of God to execute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His will on earth, and raised to Persia's throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Cyrus</span>, all hearts pay homage. Touched with tints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most clear by the historian's magic art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy features wear a gentleness and grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlike the stern cold aspect and the frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the dark chiefs of yore, the gloomy clan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heroes, from humanity and love                              <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Removed: To thee a brighter character<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belongs&mdash;high dignity, unbending truth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Nature; not that lordly apathy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which confidence and human sympathy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Represses, but a soul that bids all hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling approach. We almost burn in thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kiss the hand that loosed Panthea's chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless him with a parent's, husband's tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stood a guardian angel in distress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the unfriended, and the beautiful,                          <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consigned a helpless slave. Thy portrait, touched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tints of softest light, thus wins all hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To love thee; but severer policy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cyrus, pronounces otherwise: she hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stir of commerce on the sullen marge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waters that along thy empire's verge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat cheerless; no proud moles arise; no ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freighted with Indian wealth, glide o'er the main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From cape to cape. But on the desert sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurtles thy numerous host, seizing, in thought                 <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapacious, the rich fields of Hindostan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the poor savage fells the blooming tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain its tempting fruit; but woe the while!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the wilderness the noise is lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all thy archers;&mdash;they have ceased;&mdash;the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blows o'er them, and the voice of judgment cries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So perish they who grasp with avarice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another's blessed portion, and disdain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That interchange of mutual good, that crowns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slow, sure toil of commerce.                               <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i32">It was thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal son of Macedon! to hang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the high fane of maritime renown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fairest trophies of thy fame, and shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Then</span> only like a god, when thy great mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swayed in its master council the deep tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of things, predestining th' eventful roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of commerce, and uniting either world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Europe and Asia, in thy vast design.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twas when the victor, in his proud career,                   <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er ravaged Hindostan, had now advanced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond Hydaspes; on the flowery banks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hyphasis, with banners thronged, his camp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was spread. On high he bade the altars rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awful records to succeeding years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his long march of glory, and to point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spot where, like the thunder rolled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His army paused. Now shady eve came down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trumpet sounded to the setting sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That looked from his illumed pavilion, calm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>                    <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the scene of arms, as if, all still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lovely as his parting light, the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath him spread; nor clangours, nor deep groans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were heard, nor victory's shouts, nor sighs, nor shrieks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were ever wafted from a bleeding land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the havoc of a conqueror's sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So calm the sun declined; when from the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shone to his last beam, a Brahmin old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came forth. His streaming beard shone in the ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That slanted o'er his feeble frame; his front                  <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was furrowed. To the sun's last light he cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look of sorrow, then in silence bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the conqueror of the world. At once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, as in death, was still. The victor chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembled, he knew not why; the trumpet ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its clangor, and the crimson streamer waved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more in folds insulting to the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the reposing world. The pallid front<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the meek man seemed for a moment calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dark and thronging thoughts appeared to swell              <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beating heart. He paused&mdash;and then abrupt:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Victor, avaunt! he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence! and the banners of thy pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear to the deep! Behold on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon range of mountains mingled with the sky!<br /></span>
<span class="i24">It is the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the great Father of the human race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rested, when all the world and all its sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceased; and the ocean that surrounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth, leaped from its dark abode                          <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the mountains, and enormous flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green earth deluging! List, soldier, list!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dread His might no mortal may resist.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Great Bramah rested, hushed in sleep,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">When Hayagraiva<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mooned horns and eyes of flame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Far from the sun's rejoicing ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the huge abyss, the buried treasures lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then foamed the billowy desert wide,                           <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">And all that breathed&mdash;they died,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The oars keep time, while bold Nearchus guides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft the gallies. On the foremost prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch from his golden goblet pours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A full libation to the gods, and calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By name the mighty rivers, through whose course<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Henry! thy ardent mind first pierced the gloom<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That lowered upon the woody skirts, and veiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From mortal search, with umbrage ominous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madeira's unknown isle. But look! the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is kindled on the shadowy offing; streaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of clear cold light on Sagres' battlements<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are cast, where Henry watches, listening still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the unwearied surge; and turning still<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A sail appears; it swells, it shines: more high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen through the dusk it looms; and now the hull                <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is black upon the surge, whilst she rolls on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft&mdash;the weather-beaten ship&mdash;and now<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What tidings?<br /></span>
<span class="i10">The loud storm of night prevailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swept our vessel from Bojador's rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far out to sea; a sylvan isle<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> received<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Prosper our wishes, Father of the world!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We speed to Asia.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Soon upon the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brave ship speeds again. Bojador's rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise at distance, frowning o'er the surf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That boils for many a league without. Its course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship holds on; till lo! the beauteous isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shielded late the sufferers from the storm,               <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Springs o'er the wave again. Here they refresh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wasted strength, and lift their vows to Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Heaven denies their further search; for ah!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fearful apparition, palled in clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever sits upon the Western wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like night, and in its strange portentous gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapping the lonely waters, seems the bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature? Still it sits, day after day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same mysterious vision. Holy saints!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it the dread abyss where all things cease?                  <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or haply hid from mortal search, thine isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cipango, and that unapproached seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of peace, where rest the Christians whom the hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Moorish pride pursued? Whate'er it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zarco, thy holy courage bids thee on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To burst the gloom, though dragons guard the shore,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or beings more than mortal pace the sands.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The favouring gales invite; the bowsprit bears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right onward to the fearful shade; more black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloudy spectre towers; already fear                        <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrinks at the view aghast and breathless. Hark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas more than the deep murmur of the surge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That struck the ear; whilst through the lurid gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gigantic phantoms seem to lift in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their misty arms; yet, yet&mdash;bear boldly on&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mist dissolves;&mdash;seen through the parting haze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Romantic rocks, like the depictured clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine out; beneath a blooming wilderness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of varied wood is spread, that scents the air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fruits of "golden rind," thick interspersed              <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pendent, through the mantling umbrage gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inviting. Cypress here, and stateliest pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spire o'er the nether shades, as emulous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sole distinction where all nature smiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some trees, in sunny glades alone their head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And graceful stem uplifting, mark below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The turf with shadow; whilst in rich festoons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowery lianes braid their boughs; meantime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choirs of innumerous birds of liveliest song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brightest plumage, flitting through the shades,            <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nimble glance are seen; they, unalarmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now near in airy circles sing, then speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their random flight back to their sheltering bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose silence, broken only by their song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the foundation of this busy world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps had never echoed to the voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or heard the steps, of Man. What rapture fired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strangers' bosoms, as from glade to glade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They passed, admiring all, and gazing still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With new delight! 'Tis solitude around;                        <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep solitude, that on the gloom of woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prim&aelig;val fearful hangs: a green recess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now opens in the wilderness; gay flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of unknown name purple the yielding sward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ring-dove murmurs o'er their head, like one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attesting tenderest joy; but mark the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, slanting through the gloom, the sunshine rests!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath, a moss-grown monument appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er which the green banana gently waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its long leaf; and an aged cypress near                        <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leans, as if listening to the streamlet's sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gushes from the adverse bank; but pause&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approach with reverence! Maker of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a Christian's cross! and on the stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A name, yet legible amid its moss,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anna!<br /></span>
<span class="i14">In that remote, sequestered spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut as it seemed from all the world, and lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In boundless seas, to trace a name, to mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The emblems of their holy faith, from all                      <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew tears; while every voice faintly pronounced,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To louder tones, oh! let my hand, awhile,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her name and fate, who in this desert deep,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her long and last abode; there where no eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might shed a tear on her remains; no heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sigh in remembrance of her fate:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i30">She left                         <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Severn's side, and fled with him she loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the wide main; for he had told her tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of happiness in distant lands, where care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes not; and pointing to the golden clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shone above the waves, when evening came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispered&mdash;Oh, are there not sweet scenes of peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the murmurs of this cloudy mart,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where gold alone bears sway,&mdash;scenes of delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where love may lay his head upon the lap<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the low-thoughted throng, that place in wealth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their only bliss! Yes, there are scenes like these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave the vain chidings of the world behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Country, and hollow friends, and fly with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where love and peace in distant vales invite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wouldst thou here! Oh, shall thy beauteous look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of maiden innocence, thy smile of youth, thine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tenderness and soft subdued desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy form, thy limbs&mdash;oh, madness!&mdash;be the prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a decrepit spoiler, and for gold?&mdash;                         <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perish his treasure with him. Haste with me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall find out some sylvan nook, and then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou shouldst sometimes think upon these hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they are distant far, and drop a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes&mdash;I will kiss it from thy cheek, and clasp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy angel beauties closer to my breast;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whilst the winds blow o'er us, and the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks beautifully down, and thy soft cheek<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the moon shone upon the wandering stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She paced the castle's battlements, that threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath their solemn shadow, and, resigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fancy and to tears, thought it most sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wander o'er the world with him she loved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was his birth ignoble, for he shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid England's gallant youth in Edward's reign:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Commanding (yet suffused in tenderness<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Accomplished, generous, gentle, brave, sincere,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robert a Machin. But the sullen pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of haughty D'Arfet scorned all other claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his high heritage, save what the pomp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of amplest wealth and loftier lineage gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reckless of human tenderness, that seeks<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His hard ambition ended; for he sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By secret whispers of conspiracies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sovereign to abuse, bidding him lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arm avenging, and upon a youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of promise close the dark forgotten gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of living sepulture, and in the gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inhume the slowly-wasting victim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>                              <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i40">So<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He purposed, but in vain; the ardent youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rescued her&mdash;her whom more than life he loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n when the horrid day of sacrifice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew nigh. He pointed to the distant bark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while he kissed a stealing tear that fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her pale cheek, as trusting she reclined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head upon his breast, with ardour cried&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be mine, be only mine! the hour invites;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be mine, be only mine! So won, she cast                        <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look of last affection on the towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she had passed her infant days, that now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone to the setting sun. I follow thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faint voice said; and lo! where in the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sail hangs tremulous, and soon her feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascend the vessel's side: The vessel glides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the smooth current, as the twilight fades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till soon the woods of Severn, and the spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where D'Arfet's solitary turrets rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is lost; a tear starts to her eye, she thinks                  <span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him whose gray head to the earth shall bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he speaks nothing&mdash;but be all, like death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten. Gently blows the placid breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oh! that now some fairy pinnace light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might flit across the wave (by no seen power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Directed, save when Love upon the prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered or spread with tender hand the sail),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now some fairy pinnace, o'er the surge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent, as in a summer's dream, might waft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passengers upon the conscious flood                        <span class="linenum">270</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To regions bright of undisturbed joy!<br /></span>
<span class="i36">But hark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind is in the shrouds;&mdash;the cordage sings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fitful violence;&mdash;the blast now swells,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sinks. Dread gloom invests the further wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose foaming toss alone is seen, beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veering bowsprit.<br /></span>
<span class="i21">Oh, retire to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maiden, whose tender heart would beat, whose cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn pale to see another thus exposed!                         <span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! the deep thunder louder peals&mdash;Oh, save!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The high mast crashes; but the faithful arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love is o'er thee, and thy anxious eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as the gray of morning peeps, shall view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green Erin's hills aspiring!<br /></span>
<span class="i29">The sad morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes forth; but terror on the sunless wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, like a sea-fiend, sits, and darkly smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the flash that through the struggling clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bursts frequent, half revealing his scathed front,             <span class="linenum">290</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the rocking of the waste that rolls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boundless around.<br /></span>
<span class="i15">No word through the long day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke;&mdash;another slowly came;&mdash;no word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous drooping mourner spoke. The sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve times had sunk beneath the sullen surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheerless rose again:&mdash;Ah, where are now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy havens, France! But yet&mdash;resign not yet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye lost seafarers&mdash;oh, resign not yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hope&mdash;the storm is passed; the drenched sail               <span class="linenum">300</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines in the passing beam! Look up, and say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven, thou hast heard our prayers!<br /></span>
<span class="i31">And lo! scarce seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A distant dusky spot appears;&mdash;they reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unknown shore, and green and flowery vales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And azure hills, and silver-gushing streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine forth; a Paradise, which Heaven alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who saw the silent anguish of despair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could raise in the waste wilderness of waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gain the haven; through untrodden scenes,                 <span class="linenum">310</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps untrodden by the foot of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since first the earth arose, they wind. The voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature hails them here with music, sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As waving woods retired, or falling streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can make; most soothing to the weary heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubly to those who, struggling with their fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wearied long with watchings and with grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek but a place of safety. All things here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whisper repose and peace; the very birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That 'mid the golden fruitage glance their plumes,             <span class="linenum">320</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The songsters of the lonely valley, sing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome from scenes of sorrow, live with us.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wild wood opens, and a shady glen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appears, embowered with mantling laurels high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sloping shade the flowery valley's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lucid stream, with gentle murmur, strays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the umbrageous multitude of leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till gaining, with soft lapse, the nether plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It glances light along its yellow bed;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shaggy inmates of the forest lick                          <span class="linenum">330</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feet of their new guests, and gazing stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauteous tree upshoots amid the glade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its trembling top; and there upon the bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rest them, while each heart o'erflows with joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now evening, breathing richer odours sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down: a softer sound the circling seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient woods resounded, while the dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her murmurs interposing, tenderness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awaked, yet more endearing, in the hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those who, severed wide from human kind,                    <span class="linenum">340</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woman and man, by vows sincere betrothed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard but the voice of Nature. The still moon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose&mdash;they saw it not&mdash;cheek was to cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inclined, and unawares a stealing tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Witnessed how blissful was that hour, that seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not of the hours that time could count. A kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stole on the listening silence; ne'er till now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here heard; they trembled, ev'n as if the Power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made the world, that planted the first pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Paradise, amid the garden walked:&mdash;                         <span class="linenum">350</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This since the fairest garden that the world<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hesperian named, who feigned the watchful guard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the scaled Dragon, and the Golden Fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was this sylvan Paradise; and here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loveliest pair, from a hard world remote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon each other's neck reclined; their breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone was heard, when the dove ceased on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her plaint; and tenderly their faithful arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infolded each the other.                                       <span class="linenum">360</span><br /></span>
<span class="i25">Thou, dim cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from the search of men these beauteous vales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast closed, oh, doubly veil them! But alas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How short the dream of human transport! Here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain they built the leafy bower of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or culled the sweetest flowers and fairest fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hours unheeded stole! but ah, not long&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the hollow tempest of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds through the leaves; the inmost woods resound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow comes the dawn, but neither ship nor sail                 <span class="linenum">370</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the rocking of the windy waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is seen: the dash of the dark-heaving wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone is heard. Start from your bed of bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor victims! never more shall ye behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your native vales again; and thou, sweet child!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, listening to the voice of love, hast left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beset), atone ev'n now thy rash resolves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, fruitless hope! Day after day, thy bloom<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The only drooping thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i25">Thy look was soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet most animated, and thy step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light as the roe's upon the mountains. Now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sittest hopeless, pale, beneath the tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fanned its joyous leaves above thy head,                  <span class="linenum">390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where love had decked the blooming bower, and strewn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweets of summer: <span class="smcap">Death</span> is on thy cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy chill hand the pressure scarce returns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him, who, agonised and hopeless, hangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears and trembling o'er thee. Spare the sight,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She faints&mdash;she dies!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i23">He laid her in the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself scarce living, and upon her tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the beauteous tree where they reclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placed the last tribute of his earthly love.                   <span class="linenum">400</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Land! land! aloud is echoed; but the spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fades as the shouting crew delighted gaze&mdash;                    <span class="linenum">520</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fades, and there is nothing&mdash;nothing now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the blue sky, the clouds, and surging seas!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As one who, in the desert, faint with thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the trackless and forsaken sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks dying; him the burning haze deceives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mocking his last torments, while it seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his distempered vision, like th' expanse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lucid waters cool: so falsely smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' illusive land upon the water's edge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Its headlands and its distant trending shores;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all is false, and like the pensive dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of poor imagination, 'mid the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of troubled life, decked with unreal hues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ending soon in emptiness and tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis midnight, and the thoughtful chief, retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the vexed crowd, in his still cabin hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The surge that rolls below; he lifts his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And casts a silent anxious look without.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It is a light&mdash;great God&mdash;it is a light!                     <span class="linenum">540</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It moves upon the shore!&mdash;Land&mdash;there is land!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke in secret, and a tear of joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stole down his cheek, when on his knees he fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, who hast been his guardian in wastes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hoar deep, accept his tears, his prayers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thus he fondly hopes the purer light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy great truths on the benighted world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall beam!<br /></span>
<span class="i11">The lingering night is past;&mdash;the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines out, while now the red-cross streamers wave             <span class="linenum">550</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High up the gently-surging bay. From all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouts, songs, and rapturous thanksgiving loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst forth: Another world, entranced they cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another living world!&mdash;Awe-struck and mute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gazing natives stand, and drop their spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In homage to the gods!<br /></span>
<span class="i18">So from the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hail emerging; sight more awful far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ever yet the wondering voyager<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greeted;&mdash;the prospect of a new-found world,                   <span class="linenum">560</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from the night of dark uncertainty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once revealed in living light!<br /></span>
<span class="i31">How beats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart! What thronging thoughts awake! Whence sprung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roaming nations? From that ancient race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That peopled Asia&mdash;Noah's sons? How, then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed they the long and lone expanse between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stormy ocean, from the elder earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut off, and lost, for unknown ages, lost<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stands in thy sight revealed, Spirit, awake<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The straits are passed! Thou, as the seas expand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pausest a moment, when beneath thine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue, vast, and rocking, through its boundless rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long Pacific stretches. Nor here cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy search, but with De Quiros<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> to the South<br /></span>

<span class="i26">So be thy search<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such are thy views, <span class="smcap">Discovery</span>! The great world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls to thine eye revealed; to thee the Deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Submits its awful empire; Industry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awakes, and Commerce to the echoing marts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From east to west unwearied pours her wealth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man walks sublimer; and Humanity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matured by social intercourse, more high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More animated, lifts her sovereign mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waves her golden sceptre. Yet the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asks trembling, is no evil found! Oh, turn,                     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meek Charity, and drop a human tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sad fate of Afric's injured sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide, for ever hide, the sight of chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anguish, and bondage! Yes, the heart of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sick, and Charity turns pale, to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon, for pure religion's holy beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark crimes, that sullied the sweet day, pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like vultures, the Discoverer's ocean tract,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Screaming for blood, to fields of rich Peru,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ravaged Mexico, while Gold more Gold!                        <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The caverned mountains echoed, Gold more Gold!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then see the fell-eyed, prowling buccaneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grim as a libbard! He his jealous look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns to the dagger at his belt, his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By instinct grasps a bloody scymitar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ghastly is his smile, as o'er the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sees the smoke of burning villages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascend, and thinks ev'n now he counts his spoil.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See thousands destined to the lurid mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to see the sun again; all names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>                           <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of husband, sire, all tender charities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love, deep buried with them in that grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where life is as a thing long passed; and hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more its sickly ray, to cheer the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extends.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Thou, too, dread Ocean, toss thine arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting, for the treasures and the gems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thy dark oozy realm emblaze; and call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pale procession of the dead, from caves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where late their bodies weltered, to attend                     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy kingly sceptre, and proclaim thy might!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord of the Hurricane! bid all thy winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swell, and destruction ride upon the surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, after the red lightning flash that shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The labouring ship, all is at once deep night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long suspense, till the slow dawn of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams on the scattered corses of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That strew the sounding shore!<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Then think of him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye who rejoice with those you love, at eve,                     <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When winds of winter shake the window-frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more endear your fire, oh, think of him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, saved alone from the destroying storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is cast on some deserted rock; who sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sun after sun descend, and hopeless hears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At morn the long surge of the troubled main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beats without his wretched cave; meantime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fears to wake the echoes with his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dread the solitude!<br /></span>
<span class="i19">Let Greenland's snows                        <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shine, and mark the melancholy train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There left to perish, whilst the cold pale day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declines along the further ice, that binds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship, and leaves in night the sinking scene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad winter closes on the deep; the smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of frost, that late amusive to the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose o'er the coast, is passed, and all is now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One torpid blank; the freezing particles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown blistering, and the white bear seeks her cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill-fated outcasts, when the morn again                         <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall streak with feeble beam the frozen waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your air-bleached and unburied carcases<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall press the ground, and, as the stars fade off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your stony eyes glare 'mid the desert snows!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These triumphs boast, fell Demon of the Deep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though never more the universal shriek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that perish thou shalt hear, as when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep foundations of the guilty earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were shaken at the voice of God, and man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceased in his habitations; yet the sea                          <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy might tempestuous still, and joyless rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confesses. Ah! what bloodless shadows throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n now, slow rising from their oozy beds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Mete,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and those gates of burial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That guard the Erythr&aelig;an; from the vast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfathomed caverns of the Western main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stormy Orcades; whilst the sad shell<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I see the chiefs, who fell in distant lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prey of murderous savages, when yells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouts, and conch, resounded through the woods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magellan and De Solis seem to lead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful train. Shade of Perouse! oh, say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in the tract of unknown seas, thy bones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' insulting surge has swept?<br /></span>
<span class="i28">But who is he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose look, though pale and bloody, wears the trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pure philanthropy? The pitying sigh                         <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid not; he was dear to Britons, dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every beating heart, far as the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extends; and my faint faltering touch ev'n now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies on the strings, when I pronounce thy name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, lost, lamented, generous, hapless Cook!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But cease the vain complaint; turn from the shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wet with his blood, Remembrance: cast thine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the long seas, and the wider world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displayed from his research. Smile, glowing Health!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now no more the wasted seaman sinks,                       <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With haggard eye and feeble frame diseased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more with tortured longings for the sight<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On Nature, when before his swimming eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The liquid long expanse of cheerless seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems all one flowery plain. Then frantic dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise; his eye's distemper'd flash is seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sunk socket, as a demon there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat mocking, till he plunges in the flood,<br /></span>

<span class="i28">Red Papacy<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mossy and damp, for many a league, the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With languid beam scarce pierces, here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touching some solitary trunk, the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark waving in the noxious atmosphere:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the fell crocodile are heard. At length,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By man's superior energy and toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunless brakes are cleared; the joyous morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines through the opening leaves; rich culture smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around; and howling to their distant wilds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The savage inmates of the wood retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the scene of human life, till want                     <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Adorned with lovelier graces. Then the charms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woman, fairest of the works of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the cold savage, in his sullen pride,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With more attractive influence wins the heart                  <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ne'er scattered sorrow over distant lands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask of the East, have never thy proud sails<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The gloomy haunts of sorrow; thou hast shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beam of comfort and of righteousness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On isles remote; hast bid the bread-fruit shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' Hesperian regions, and has softened much<br /></span>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></h2>


<p>It is not necessary to relate the causes which induced me to publish
this poem without a name.</p>

<p>The favour with which it has been received may make me less diffident in
avowing it; and, as a second edition has been generally called for, I
have endeavoured to make it, in every respect, less unworthy of the
public eye.</p>

<p>I have availed myself of every sensible objection, the most material of
which was the circumstance, that the Indian maid, described in the first
book, had not a part assigned to her of sufficient interest in the
subsequent events of the poem, and that the character of the Missionary
was not sufficiently professional.</p>

<p>The single circumstance that a Spanish commander, with his army in South
America, was destroyed by the Indians, in consequence of the treachery
of his page, who was a native, and that only a priest was saved, is all
that has been taken from history. The rest of this poem, the personages,
father, daughter, wife, <i>et cet.</i> (with the exception of the names of
Indian warriors) is imaginary. The time is two months. The first four
books include as many days and nights. The rest of the time is occupied
by the Spaniards' march, the assembly of warriors, <i>et cet.</i></p>

<p>The place in which the scene is laid, was selected because South America
has of late years received additional interest, and because the ground
was at once new, poetical, and picturesque.</p>

<p>From old-fashioned feelings, perhaps, I have admitted some a&euml;rial
agents, or what is called machinery. It is true that the spirits cannot
be said to accelerate or retard the events; but surely they may be
allowed to show a sympathy with the fate of those, among whom poetical
fancy has given them a prescriptive ideal existence. They may be further
excused, as relieving the narrative, and adding to the imagery.</p>

<p>The causes which induced me to publish this poem without a name, induced
me also to attempt it in a versification to which I have been least
accustomed, which, to my ear, is most uncongenial, and which is, in
itself, most difficult. I mention this, in order that, if some passages
should be found less harmonious than they might have been, the candour
of the reader may pardon them.</p>


<p><i>Scene</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">South America</span>.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Valdivia, commander of the Spanish armies&mdash;Lautaro, his
page, a native of Chili&mdash;Anselmo, the missionary&mdash;Indiana, his adopted
daughter, wife of Lautaro&mdash;Zarinel, the wandering minstrel.</p>

<p><i>Indians.</i>&mdash;Attacapac, father of Lautaro&mdash;Olola, his daughter, sister of
Lautaro&mdash;Caupolican, chief of the Indians&mdash;Indian warriors.</p>

<p>The chief event of the poem turns upon the conduct of Lautaro; but as
the Missionary acts so distinguished a part, and as the whole of the
moral depends upon him, it was thought better to retain the title which
was originally given to the poem.</p>

<span class="i0">Lautaro was a graceful Indian boy:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Startled the condor, on the craggy height;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then silent sat, and marked its upward flight,                 <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lessening in ether to a speck of white.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when the impassioned chieftain spoke of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote his broad breast, or pointed to a scar,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke of the strangers of the distant main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the proud banners of insulting Spain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the barbed horse and iron horseman spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his red gods, that, wrapped in rolling smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared from the guns;&mdash;the boy, with still-drawn breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung on the wondrous tale, as mute as death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then raised his animated eyes, and cried,                      <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let me perish by my father's side!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once, when the moon, o'er Chillan's cloudless height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured, far and wide, its softest, mildest light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A predatory band of mailed men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst on the stillness of the sheltered glen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shouted, Death! and shook their sabres high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shone terrific to the moonlight sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er they rode, the valley and the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed the shrieks of death, till all again was still.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The warrior, ere he sank in slumber deep,                    <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had kissed his son, soft-breathing in his sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where on a Llama's skin he lay, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placing his hand, with tears, upon his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A&euml;rial nymphs!<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> that in the moonlight stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O gentle spirits! here awhile delay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless, as ye pass unseen, my sleeping boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till blithe he wakes to daylight and to joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the <span class="smcap">great spirit</span> will, in future days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the fall'n foe his hatchet he shall raise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, 'mid a grateful nation's high applause,                   <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avenge his violated country's cause!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, nearer points of spears, and many a cone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of moving helmets, in the moonlight shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, clanking through the pass, the band of blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang, like hy&aelig;nas, from the secret wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rush, they seize their unresisting prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruthless they tear the shrieking boy away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, not till gashed by many a sabre wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father sank, expiring, on the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He waked from the dark trance to life and pain,                <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never saw his darling child again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seven snows had fallen, and seven green summers passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since here he heard that son's loved accents last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still his beloved daughter soothed his cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst time began to strew with white his hairs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft as his painted feathers he unbound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gazed upon his hatchet on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musing with deep despair, nor strove to speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light she approached, and climbed to reach his cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held with both hands his forehead, then her head               <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew smiling back, and kissed the tear he shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But late, to grief and hopeless love a prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She left his side, and wandered far away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in this still and shelter'd glen, that smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the crags of precipices wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in a stern yet sorrowful repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warrior half forgot his country's woes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot how many, impotent to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed their best blood upon a father's grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many, torn from wife and children, pine                    <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dark caverns of the hopeless mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to see again the blessed morn;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slaves in the lovely land where they were born;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many at sad sunset, with a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distant roar of sullen cannons hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst evening seems, as dies the sound, to throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deadlier stillness on a nation's woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So the dark warrior, day succeeding day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wore in distempered thought the noons away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still, when weary evening came, he sighed,                 <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son, my son! or, with emotion, cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I descend to the cold grave alone,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The crimson orb of day now westering flung<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When from afar a shrilling sound was heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hurrying o'er the dews, a scout appeared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watchful warrior knew the piercing tones,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And from the myrtles hung its trembling nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sounds of a conflicting world were near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise of ocean faintly met the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seemed, as sunk to rest the noontide blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dying sounds of passions that were past;                   <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or closing anthems, when, far off, expire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lessening echoes of the distant choir.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here, every human sorrow hushed to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pale hands meekly crossed upon his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anselmo sat: the sun, with westering ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just touched his temples, and his locks of gray.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no worldly feeling in his eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world to him was "as a thing gone by."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, all his features lit, he raised his look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bent it thoughtful, and unclasped the book;               <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whilst the hour-glass shed its silent sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tame opossum<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> licked his withered hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweetest light of slow-declining day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which through the trellis poured its slanting ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resting a moment on his few gray hairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed light from heaven sent down to bless his prayers.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the trump echoed to the quiet spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought upon the world, but mourned it not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough if his meek wisdom could control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bend to mercy, one proud soldier's soul;                   <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough, if, while these distant scenes he trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led one erring Indian to his God.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whence comes my son? with kind complacent look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked, and closed again the embossed book.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I come to thee for peace, the youth replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, there is strife, and cruelty, and pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this sad Christian world! My native land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was happy, ere the soldier, with his band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fell destroyers, like a vulture, came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave its peaceful scenes to blood and flame.               <span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When will the turmoil of earth's tempests cease?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, I come to thee for peace&mdash;for peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seek peace, the father cried, with God above:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In His good time, all will be peace and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We mourn, indeed, mourn that all sounds of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth's fairest scenes with one deep murmur fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That yonder sun, when evening paints the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks, beauteous, on a world of misery;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The course of wide destruction to withstand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We lift our feeble voice&mdash;our trembling hand;                  <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still, bowed low, or smitten to the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father of mercy, still in Thee we trust!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through good or ill, in poverty or wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In joy or woe, in sickness or in health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meek Piety thy awful hand surveys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the faint murmur turns to prayer and praise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know&mdash;whatever evils we deplore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast permitted, and we know no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, illustrious on the subject plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some tow'r-crowned city of imperial Spain!                     <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ascend from earth, where tower and temple shone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the conqueror's dread path: the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yawns for its millions where his banners wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shall vain man, whose life is but a sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sullen acquiescence gaze and die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, how little of the mighty maze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Providence our mortal ken surveys!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's awful Lord, pavilioned in the clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks through the darkness that all nature shrouds;            <span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, far beyond the tempest and the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bids man his course hold on to scenes of endless light.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My youth was passed. Oh, days for ever gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How touched with Heaven's own light your mornings shone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even now, when lonely and forlorn I bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My weary journey hastening to its end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A drooping exile on a distant shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mourn the hours of youth that are no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender thought amid my prayers has part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steals, at times, from Heaven my aged heart.                <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forgive the cause, O God!&mdash;forgive the tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flows, even now, o'er Leonora's bier;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, 'midst the innocent and lovely, none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More beautiful than Leonora shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As by her widowed mother's side she knelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sad and sacred sympathy I felt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Easter-tide, when the high mass was sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fuming high, the silver censer swung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rich-hued windows, from the arches' height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured o'er the shrines a soft and yellow light;                <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From aisle to aisle, amid the service clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When "Adoremus" swelled upon the ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such as to Heaven thy rapt attention drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First in the Christian churches of Peru),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seemed, methought, some spirit of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descending to that holy harmony.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But wherefore tell, when life and hope were new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How by degrees the soul's first passion grew!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved her, and I won her virgin heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fortune whispered, we a while must part.                    <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The minster tolled the middle hour of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, waked to agony and wild affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard those words, words of appalling dread&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Holy Inquisition!"&mdash;from the bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I started; snatched my dagger, and my cloak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dare accuse me!&mdash;none, in answer, spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The demons seized, in silence, on their prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tore me from my dreams of bliss away.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How frightful was their silence, and their shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In torch-light, as their victim they conveyed,                  <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By dark-inscribed, and massy-windowed walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the dim twilight of terrific halls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For thou hast heard me speak of that foul stain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pure religion, and the rights of Spain;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the high windows shook to night's cold blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And echoed to the foot-fall as we passed!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They left me, faint and breathless with affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a cold cell, to solitude and night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! think, what horror through the heart must thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the last bolt was barred, and all at once was still!       <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor day nor night was here, but a deep gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadder than darkness, wrapped the living tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bread and water, nature to sustain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duly was brought when eve returned again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus I knew, hoping it were the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another day of lingering life was passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Five years immured in that deep den of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never saw the sweet sun's blessed light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once as the grate, with sullen sound, was barred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the bolts the inmost cavern jarred,                      <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought I heard, as clanged the iron door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dull and hollow echo from the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stamped; the vault, and winding caves around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returned a long and melancholy sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With patient toil I raised a massy stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked into a depth of shade unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murky twilight of the lurid place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helped me, at length, a secret way to trace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I entered; step by step explored the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkness, from my desolate abode;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>                            <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, winding through long passages of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, at distance, a dim streak of light:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the sun&mdash;the bright, the blessed beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of day! I knelt&mdash;I wept;&mdash;the glittering stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled on beneath me, as I left the cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concealed in woods above the winding wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I rested on a verdant bank a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw around the summer landscape smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gained a peasant's hut; nor dared to leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, with slow step, advanced the glimmering eve.             <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering still affection's fondest hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned my footsteps to the city towers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pilgrim's dress, I traced the streets unknown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No light in Leonora's lattice shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The morning came; the busy tumult swells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knolling to church, I heard the minster bells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involuntary to that scene I strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disguised, where first I saw my faithful maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw her, pallid, at the altar stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yield, half-shrinking, her reluctant hand;                 <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned her head; she saw my hollow eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew me, wasted, wan, in my disguise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shrieked, and fell;&mdash;breathless, I left the fane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In agony&mdash;nor saw her form again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from that day her voice, her look were given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her name, her memory, to the winds of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far off I bent my melancholy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-sick and faint, and, in this gown of gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every human eye my sorrows hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown, amidst the tumult of Madrid.                          <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief in my heart, despair upon my look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no companion save my beads and book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My morsel with Affliction's sons to share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tend the sick and poor, my only care,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten, thus I lived; till day by day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had worn nigh thirteen years of grief away.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One winter's night, when I had closed my cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid the labours of the day farewell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged crone approached, with panting breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade me hasten to the house of death.                      <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">I came. With moving lips intent to pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dying woman on a pallet lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lifted hands were wasted to the bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ghastly on her look the lamp-light shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the bed a pious daughter stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent, and, weeping, kisses her pale hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feebly she spoke, and raised her languid head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive, forgive!&mdash;they told me he was dead!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the sunshine of that dreadful day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gave me to another's arms away,                           <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him, like a ghost, with deadly stare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw his wasted eye-balls' ghastly glare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw his lips (oh, hide them, God of love!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw his livid lips, half-muttering, move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To curse the maid&mdash;forgetful of her vow:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps he lives to curse&mdash;to curse me now!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He lives to bless! I cried; and, drawing nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held up the crucifix; her heavy eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She raised, and scarce pronounced&mdash;Does he yet live?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can he his lost, his dying child forgive?                      <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will God forgive&mdash;the Lord who bled&mdash;will He?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, no, there is no mercy left for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Words were but vain, and colours all too faint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That awful moment of despair to paint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knew me; her exhausted breath, with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing, she pressed my hand, and spoke again:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy virtues blooming, like a winter's flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From chains and slavery I redeemed thy youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured on thy mental sight the beams of truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thy warm heart and mild demeanour won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called thee my other child&mdash;my age's son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I need not tell the sequel;&mdash;not unmoved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Indiana heard thy tale, and loved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some sympathy a kindred fate might claim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your years, your fortunes, and your friend the same;           <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both early of a parent's care bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both strangers in a world of sadness left;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I marked each slowly-struggling thought; I shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tear of love paternal on each head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while I saw her timid eyes incline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed the affection that had made her thine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here let the murmurs of despondence cease:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a God&mdash;believe&mdash;and part in peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rich hues illumed the track of dying day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the great sun sank in the western bay,                      <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only its last light yet lingering shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the highest palm-tree's feathery cone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When at a distance on the dewy plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mingled group appeared an Indian train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men, women, children, round Anselmo press,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell! they cried. He raised his hand to bless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: My children, may the God above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lead you in the paths of peace and love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, we must part;&mdash;when I am gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raise on this spot a cross, and place a stone,                 <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tribes unborn may some memorial have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I far off am mouldering in the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that poor messenger, who tidings bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Gospel-mercy to your distant shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The crowd retired; along the twilight gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The condor kept its solitary way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire-flies shone, when to the hermit's cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hastens but the minstrel Zarinel!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In foreign lands, far from his native home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas his, a gay, romantic youth, to roam,                     <span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a light cittern o'er his shoulders slung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er he passed he played, and loved, and sung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus accomplished, late had joined the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gallant soldiers on the southern plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, he cried, uncertain of the fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That may to-morrow's toilsome march await,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For long will be the road, I would confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some secret thoughts that on my bosom press.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are of one I left, an Indian maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose trusting love my careless heart betrayed.                <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, may I speak?<br /></span>
<span class="i15">Say on, the father cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor be to penitence all hope denied.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then hear, Anselmo! From a very child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved all fancies marvellous and wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned from truth, to listen to the lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many an old and fabling troubadour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, with impassioned heart, and wayward mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dreams and shapes of shadowy things resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I left my native vales and village home,                       <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide o'er the world a minstrel boy to roam.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I never shall forget the day, the hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, all my soul resigned to Fancy's power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, from the snowy Pyrenees, I cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My labouring vision o'er the landscape vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw beneath my feet long vapours float,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streams, mountains, woods, and ocean's mist remote.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There once I met a soldier, poor and old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who tales of Cortes and Bilboa told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this new world; he spoke of Indian maids,                  <span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rivers like seas, and forests whose deep shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had never yet been pierced by morning ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the green bird mocked, and talked all day.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Imagination thus, in colours new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This distant world presented to my view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young, and enchanted with the fancied scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I crossed the toiling seas that roared between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with ideal images impressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood on these unknown shores a wondering guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still to romantic phantasies resigned,                       <span class="linenum">270</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I left Callao's crowded port behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And climbed the mountains which their shadow threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the lessening summits of Peru.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some sheep the armed peasants drove before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all our food through the wild passes bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had wandered in the frost-smoke of the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the track; I blew the signal horn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But echo only answered: 'mid the snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wildered and lost, I saw the evening close.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun was setting in the crimson west;                       <span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the earth I had no home of rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last sad light upon the ice-hills shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seemed forsaken in a world unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How did my cold and sinking heart rejoice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, hark! methought I heard a human voice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might be some wild Indian's roving troop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the dread echo of their distant whoop;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still it was human, and I seemed to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again some commerce with remote mankind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice comes nearer, rising through the shade&mdash;             <span class="linenum">290</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it the song of some rude mountain-maid?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I heard the tread of hastening feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in the western glen, a Llama bleat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I listened&mdash;all is still; but hark! again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near and more near is heard the welcome strain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a wild maid's carolling, who seeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wandering Llama 'midst the snowy peaks:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truant, she cried, thy lurking place is found!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With languid touch I waked the cittern's sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon a maid, by the pale light, I saw                      <span class="linenum">300</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze breathless with astonishment and awe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What instant terrors to her fancy rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ha! is it not the Spirit of the snows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she saw me, weary, cold, and weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch forth my hand (for now I could not speak),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She pitied, raised me from the snows, and led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My faltering footsteps to her father's shed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Llama followed with her tinkling bell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dwelling rose within a craggy dell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erhung with icy summits. To be brief,                        <span class="linenum">310</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was the daughter of an aged chief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, by her gentle voice to pity won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed mercy, for himself had lost a son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father spoke not; by the pine-wood blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The daughter stood, and turned a cake of maize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, as sudden shone the light, I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such features as no artist hand might draw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her form, her face, her symmetry, her air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father! thy age must such recital spare:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saved my life; and kindness, if not love,                  <span class="linenum">320</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might sure in time the coldest bosom move!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine was not cold; she loved to hear me sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes touched with playful hand the string;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I waked some melancholy strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wept, and smiled, and bade me sing again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many a happy day, in this deep glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the noise of life, and sounds of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was passed! Nay, father, the sad sequel hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas now the leafy spring-time of the year&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambition called me: true, I knew to part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would break her generous, warm, and trusting heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True, I had vowed, but now estranged and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw my look, and shuddered to behold:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would go with me, leave the lonely glade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she grew up, but my stern voice forbade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hid her face and wept: Go then away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Father, methinks, ev'n now, I hear her say)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to thy distant land, forget this tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget these rocks, forget I once was dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly to the world, o'er the wide ocean fly,                     <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave me unremembered here to die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to my father should I all relate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, instant death, would be a traitor's fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor fear, nor pity moved my stubborn mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I left her sorrows and the scene behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought Valdivia on the southern plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joined the careless military train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! ere I sleep, thus, lowly on my knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, I absolution crave from thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Anselmo spoke, with look and voice severe:                   <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, thoughtless youth, my absolution hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, by deep penitence the wrong atone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then absolution ask from God alone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet stay, and to my warning voice attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear me as a father, and a friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Truth severe be wayward Fancy's guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let stern-eyed Conscience o'er each thought preside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passions, that on noblest natures prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! cast them, like corroding bonds, away!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdain to act mean falsehood's coward part,                   <span class="linenum">360</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let religion dignify thine art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, by thy bed, thou seest at midnight stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale Conscience, pointing, with terrific hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deeds of darkness done, whilst, like a corse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shake thy soul, uprises dire Remorse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly to God's mercy, fly, ere yet too late&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps one hour marks thy eternal fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the warm tear of deep contrition flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart obdurate melt, like softening snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last vain follies of thy youth deplore,                    <span class="linenum">370</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then go, in secret weep, and sin no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stars innumerous in their watches shone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anselmo knelt before the cross alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand glowing orbs their pomp displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst, looking up, thus silently he prayed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! how oppressive to the aching sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fearful were this vast magnificence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This prodigality of glory, spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above a poor and dying emmet's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That toiled his transient hour upon the shore                  <span class="linenum">380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal life, and then was seen no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If man beheld, on his terrific throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dark, cold, distant Deity, alone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt no relating, no endearing tie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Hope might upwards raise her glistening eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think, with deep unutterable bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder radiant realm my kingdom is!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More glorious than those orbs that silent roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines Heaven's redeeming mercy on the soul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, pure effulgence of unbounded love!                         <span class="linenum">390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Thee, I think&mdash;I feel&mdash;I live&mdash;I move;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When will thy Dayspring on these realms of night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">One hallelujah of triumphant praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tibet on Fars, Andes on Atlas call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "roll the loud hosannah" round the ball!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon may Thy kingdom come, that love, and peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And charity, may bid earth's chidings cease!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy poor and feeble servant, I fulfil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As best I may, Thy high and holy will,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far in the centre of the deepest wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The assembled fathers of their country stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas midnight now; the pine-wood fire burned red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the leaves a shadowy glimmer spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The struggling smoke, or flame with fitful glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obscured, or showed, some dreadful countenance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every warrior, as his club he reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With larger shadow, indistinct, appeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While more terrific, his wild locks and mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce eye, through the quivering smoke, was seen.          <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">In sea-wolf's skin, here Mariantu stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gnashed his white teeth, impatient, and cried, blood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lofty brow, with crimson feathers bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, brooding death, the huge Ongolmo frowned;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a giant of no earthly race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his broad shoulders heaved his ponderous mace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lifted hatchet, as in act to fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stood the young and ardent Teucapel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a lone cypress, stately in decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When time has worn its summer boughs away,                      <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung its trunk with moss and lichens sere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mountain-warrior rested on his spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, and at this hour, a hundred chiefs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chosen avengers of their country's griefs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chiefs of the scattered tribes that roam the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweeps from Andes to the western main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their country-gods, around the coiling smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sacrifice, and silent prayers, invoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all, at first, were silent as the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pine was heard to whisper o'er their head,                  <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stood the stern assembly; but apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapped in the spirit of his fearful art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, to hollow sounds of hideous hum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wizard-seer struck his prophetic drum.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Silent they stood, and watched with anxious eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What phantom-shape might from the ground arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No voices came, no spectre-form appeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hollow sound, but not of winds, was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the leaves, and distant thunder low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which seemed like moans of an expiring foe.                     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crimson feathers quivering in the smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with loud voice, first Mariantu spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hail we the omen! Spirits of the slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear your voices! Mourn, devoted Spain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale-visaged tyrants! still, along our coasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we despairing mark your iron hosts!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirits of our brave fathers, curse the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thus your name, your memory disgrace!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No; though yon mountain's everlasting snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain Almagro's<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> toilsome march oppose;                   <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Atacama's long and wasteful plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be heaped with blackening carcases in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though still fresh hosts those snowy summits scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scare the Llamas with their glittering mail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though sullen castles lour along our shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though our polluted soil be drenched with gore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insolent tyrants! we, prepared to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your arms, your horses, and your gods, defy!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke: the warriors stamped upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tore the feathers that their foreheads bound.               <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insolent tyrants! burst the general cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, met for vengeance&mdash;we, prepared to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your arms, your horses, and your gods, defy!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Teucapel, with warm emotion, cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hatchet never yet in blood was dyed;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the great wizard sat:&mdash;a lurid light<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each eye-ball, as in life, was seen to roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each lip to move; but not a living soul<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The warrior half advanced his lifted spear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Say, shall I live, and drink the tyrant's gore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas silence. Speak! he cried: none made reply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once strange thunder shook the distant sky,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The second moon had now begun to wane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since bold Valdivia left the southern plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goal of his labours, Penco's port and bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far gleaming to the summer sunset lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wayworn veteran, who had slowly passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through trackless woods, or o'er savannahs vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hope impatient sees the city spires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gild the horizon, like ascending fires.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now well-known sounds salute him, as more near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The citadel and battlements appear;                             <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The approaching trumpets ring at intervals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trumpet answers from the rampart walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where many a maiden casts an anxious eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some long-lost object of her love to espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or watches, as the evening light illumes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The points of lances, or the passing plumes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grating drawbridge and the portal-arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now echo to the long battalion's march;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst every eye some friend remembered greets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the gazing crowd that throngs the streets.                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">As bending o'er his mule, amid the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive and pale, Anselmo rode along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sacred, 'mid the noise of arms, appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His venerable mien and snowy beard!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whilst every heart a silent prayer bestowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow to the convent's massy gate he rode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around, the brothers, gratulating, stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ask for tidings of the southern land.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As from the turret tolls the vesper bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seeks, a weary man, his evening cell,                        <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sounds of social cheer, no beds of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor gorgeous canopies his coming wait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But o'er a little bread, with folded hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thanking the God that gave, a while he stands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, while all thoughts of earthly sorrow cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his pallet lays him down in peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The scene how different, where the castle-hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rings to the loud triumphant festival:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred torches blaze, and flame aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long quivering shadows streak the vaulted roof,&mdash;               <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst, seen far off, the illumined windows throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A splendour on the shore and seas below.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Amid his captains, in imperial state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a crimson canopy, elate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valdivia sits&mdash;and, striking loud the strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wandering ministrel of Valentia sings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Chili conquered, fill the bowl again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Chili conquered, raise the heroic strain!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lautaro left the hall of jubilee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmarked, and wandered by the moonlit sea:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>                      <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard far off, in dissonant acclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song, the shout, and his loved country's name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As swelled at times the trump's insulting sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised his eyes impatient from the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then smote his breast indignantly, and cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chili! my country; would that I had died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the sad night of that eventful day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on the ground my murdered father lay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should not then, dejected and alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have thought I heard his injured spirit groan.                  <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ha! was it not his form&mdash;his face&mdash;his hair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold, soldier! stern, inhuman soldier, spare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ha! is it not his blood? Avenge, he cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avenge, my son, these wounds! He faints&mdash;he dies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave me, dread shadow! Can I then forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father's look&mdash;his voice? He beckons yet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now on that glimmering rock I see him stand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avenge! he cries, and waves his dim-seen hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus mused the youth, distempered and forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, hark! the sound as of a distant horn                      <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swells o'er the surge! he turned his look around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still, with many a pause, he heard the sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It came from yonder rocks; and, list! what strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks on the silence of the sleeping main?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I heard the song of gladness;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">It seemed but yesterday,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But it turned my thoughts to madness,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">So soon it died away:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I sound my sea-shell; but in vain I try<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To bring back that enchanting harmony!                        <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hark! heard ye not the surges say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! heartless maid, what canst thou do?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O'er the moon-gleaming ocean, I'll wander away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And paddle to Spain in my light canoe!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The youth drew near, by the strange accents led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in a cave, wild sea-weeds round her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holding a large sea-conch in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, with wildering air, an Indian maiden stand.            <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tattered poncho o'er her shoulders hung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either side her long black locks were flung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now by the moon's glimmer, he espies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her high cheek-bones, and bright but hollow eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro spoke: Oh! say what cruel wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weighs on thy heart, maiden, what bodes thy song?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answered not, but blew her shell again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus renewed the desultory strain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, yes, we must forget! the world is wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My music now shall be the dashing tide:                        <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the calm of the deep I will frolic and swim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the breath of the South o'er the sea-blossom<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> skim.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If ever, stranger, on thy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds, more than earthly sweet, thy soul should move,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It is the youth! Oh! do not say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That poor Olola died for love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro stretched his hand; she said, Adieu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the glimmering rocks like lightning flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He followed, and still heard at distance swell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lessening echoes of that mournful shell.                   <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It ceased at once; and now he heard no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the sea's murmur dying on the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Olola!&mdash;ha! his sister had that name!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, horrid fancies! shake not thus his frame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night he wandered by the desert main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the melancholy sounds again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No torches blaze in Penco's castled hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That echoed to the midnight festival.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weary soldiers by their toils oppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had now retired to silence and to rest.                        <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The minstrel only, who the song had sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of noble Cid, as o'er the strings he hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the instrument had fall'n asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary, and now was hushed in slumbers deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tracing the scenes long past, in busy dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again he wanders by his native streams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sits, his evening saraband to sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the clear Garonne's gentle murmuring.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cold o'er the fleckered clouds the morning broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aslant ere from his slumbers he awoke;                         <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still as he sat, nor yet had left the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first dim light fell on his pallid face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wakes&mdash;he gazes round&mdash;the dawning day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes from the deep, in garb of cloudy gray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woods with crow of early turkeys ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glancing birds beneath the castle sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sole sun his rising orb displays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Radiant and reddening, through the scattered haze.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To recreate the languid sense a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When earth and ocean wore their sweetest smile,                <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wandered to the beach: the early air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blew soft, and lifted, as it blew, his hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushed was his cheek; his faded eye, more bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone with a faint but animated light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the soft morning ray seemed to bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his tired mind a transient kindred glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thus, with shadow stretching o'er the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mused and wandered on the winding strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At distance tossed upon the tumbling tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dark and floating substance he espied.                       <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood, and where the eddying surges beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Indian corse was rolled beneath his feet:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow wave retired with sullen sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of that sad corse was to the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed a female, by the slender form;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He touched the hand&mdash;it was no longer warm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned its face&mdash;O God! that eye, though dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed with its deadly glare as fixed on him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sunk his shuddering sense, how changed his hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When poor Olola in that corse he knew!                         <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro, rushing from the rocks, advanced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His keen eye, like a startled eagle's glanced:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis she!&mdash;he knew her by a mark impressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From earliest infancy beneath her breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, my poor sister! when all hopes were past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of meeting, do we meet&mdash;thus meet&mdash;at last!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then full on Zarinel, as one amazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rising wrath and stern suspicion gazed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Zarinel still knelt upon the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his forehead pressed the dead maid's hand.              <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Speak! whence art thou?<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Pale Zarinel, his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upraising answered,<br /></span>
<span class="i19">Peace is with the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him dost thou seek who injured thine and thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&mdash;strike the fell assassin&mdash;I am he!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Die! he exclaimed, and with convulsive start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant had plunged the dagger in his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the meek father, with his holy book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placid aspect, met his frenzied look.                      <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He trembled&mdash;struck his brow&mdash;and, turning round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung the uplifted dagger to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then murmured: Father, Heaven has heard thy prayer&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! the sister of my soul lies there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christian's God has triumphed! father, heap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some earth upon her bones, whilst I go weep!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anselmo with calm brow approached the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hastened with his staff his faltering pace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! child of guilt and wretchedness, he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak!&mdash;Holy father, the sad youth replied,                    <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">God bade the seas the accusing victim roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead at my feet, to teach my shuddering soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its guilt: Oh! father, holy father, pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That heaven may take the deep, dire curse away!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! yet, Anselmo cried, live and repent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not in vain was this dread warning sent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep reproaches of thy soul I spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go! seek Heaven's peace by penitence and prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The youth arose, yet trembling from the shock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And severed from the dead maid's hair a lock;                  <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This to his heart with trembling hand he pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dried the salt-sea moisture on his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They laid her limbs within the sea-beat grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed: Her soul, O blessed Mary, save!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The watchman on the tower his bugle blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swelling to the morn the streamers flew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rampart-guns a dread alarum gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoke rolled, and thunder echoed o'er the wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, starting from his couch, Valdivia cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What tidings? Of the tribes! a scout replied;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The formidable host, by holy James,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might well appal our priests and city dames!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou not fear? Nay&mdash;dost thou not reply?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by the rood, and all the saints on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hold it sin that thou shouldst lift thy hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against thy brothers in thy native land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as thou saidst, those mighty enemies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me and my feeble legions would despise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, by our holy lady, thou shalt ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spectator of their prowess, by my side!                         <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come life, come death, our battle shall display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its ensigns to the earliest beam of day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With louder summons ring the rampart-bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haste the shriving father from his cell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soldier's heart rejoices in alarms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the trump at midnight sound to arms!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now, obedient to the chief's commands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gray-haired priest before the soldier stands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, Valdivia cried, fierce are our foes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last event of war <span class="smcap">God</span> only knows;&mdash;                <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let mass be sung; father, this very night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would attend the high and holy rite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet deem not that I doubt of victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or place defeat or death before mine eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It blenches not! But, whatsoe'er befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good father, I would part in peace with all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, tell Lautaro&mdash;his ingenuous mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps may grieve, if late I seemed unkind:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear my heart speak, though far from virtue's way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambition's lure hath led my steps astray,                       <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">If hasty passions oft my spirit fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flash a moment and the next expire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro knows it. There is somewhat more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not, here&mdash;here, on this distant shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Should they, the Indian multitudes, prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this good sword and these firm sinews fail)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid my deadly enemies be found,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A dying man;&mdash;thy look, thy reverend age,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And thou may'st pay the last sad obsequies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the heaped earth where a brave soldier lies:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So <span class="smcap">God</span> be with thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i22">By the torches' light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slow procession moves; the solemn rite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is chanted: through the aisles and arches dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At intervals, is heard the imploring hymn.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now from the camp, at times, a horse's neigh<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sentinel proclaims the middle watch of night.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Meantime, as shadowy dreams arise, he roams<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where terraces, and battlements, and towers,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The vacant court sounds to the moaning blast;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lord of the western world, art thou no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valdivia, hark!&mdash;it was another groan!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another shadow comes, it is thy own!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, bind not thus his arms!&mdash;give, give him breath!             <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wipe from his bleeding brow those damps of death!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Valdivia, starting, woke. He is alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The taper in his tent yet dimly shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro, haste! he cried; Lautaro, save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy dying master! Ah! is this the brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty victor? Hush, the dream is past!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The early trumpets ring the second blast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm, arm! Ev'n now, the impatient charger neighs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, from tent to tent the trumpet brays!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By torch-light, then, Valdivia gave command,                   <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste, let Del Oro take a chosen band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With watchful caution, on his fleetest steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A troop observant on the heights to lead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now beautiful, beneath the heaven's gray arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared the main battalion's moving march;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banner of the cross was borne before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next, with aspect sad, and tresses hoar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy man went thoughtfully and pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crucifix, in silence, to his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valdivia, all in burnished steel arrayed,                      <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon whose crest the morn's effulgence played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Majestic reined his steed, and seemed alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy the southern world's imperial throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His features through the barred casque that glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pole-axe pendent from the saddle-bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dazzling armour, and the glitter bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his drawn sabre, in the orient light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak him not, now, for knightly tournament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrayed, but on emprise of prowess bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeds of deadly strife. In blooming pride,                 <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The attendant youth rode, pensive, by his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their pennoned lances, waving in the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two hundred clanking horsemen tramped behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In iron harness clad. The bugles blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high in air the sanguine ensigns flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <ins class="correction" title="Spelling varies: a cross-bowman">arbalasters</ins> next, with cross-bows slung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marched, whilst the plumed Moors their cymbals swung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Auxiliar-Indians here, a various train.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spears and bows, darkened the distant plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drums rolled, and fifes re-echoed shrill and clear,            <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At intervals, as near and yet more near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While flags and intermingled halberds shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long battalion drew its passing line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last rolled the heavy guns, a sable tier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Indians drawn, with matchmen in the rear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a straggling mule and sumpter-train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed the embattled order on the plain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till nought beneath the azure sky appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the projecting points of scarce-discovered spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Slow up the hill, with floating vapours hoar,                <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by the blue lake's long retiring shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now seen distinct, through the disparting haze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering file its bannered length displays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now winding from the woods, again appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moving line of matchlocks and of spears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part seen, part lost; the long illustrious march<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circling the swamp, now draws its various arch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seems, as on it moves, meandering slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A radiant segment of a living bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Five days the Spaniards, trooping in array,                  <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er plains and headlands, held their eastern way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the sixth early dawn, with shuddering awe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And horror, in the last defile they saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten pendent heads, from which the gore still run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All gashed, and grim, and blackening in the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These were the gallant troop that passed before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Indians' vast encampment to explore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led by Del Oro, now with many a wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced, and a headless trunk upon the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horses startled, as they tramped in blood;                 <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troops a moment half-recoiling stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But boots not now to pause, or to retire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valdivia's eye flashed with indignant fire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow! he cried, brave comrades, to the hill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And instant shouts the pealing valley fill.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now, up to the hill's ascending crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With animated look and beating breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He urged his steed; when, wide beneath his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, in long expanse, Arauco's valley lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far as the labouring sight could stretch its glance,         <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One undulating mass of club and lance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One animated surface seemed to fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many-stirring scene from hill to hill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the deep mass he pointed with his sword,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Instant the files advance, the trumpets bray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the host in terrible array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranged on the heights that overlook the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has halted!<br /></span>
<span class="i15">But the task were long and vain                 <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oft bending o'er the cataract as it foams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From streams whose bridges<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> tremble from the steep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From lakes, in summer's sweetest light asleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indians, of sullen brow and giant limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clubs terrific, and with aspects grim,                    <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flocked fearless.<br /></span>
<span class="i23">When they saw the Spanish line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrayed, and front to front, descending shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst, instant burst, the universal cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Ten thousand spears uplifted to the sky)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyrants, we come to conquer or to die!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grim Mariantu led the Indian force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-left; and, rushing to the foremost horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurled with unerring aim the involving thong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fearless sprang amidst the mailed throng.                 <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Valdivia saw the horse, entangled, reel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouting, as he rode, Castile! Castile!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led on the charge: like a descending flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It swept, till every spur was black with blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And feathered arrows, of each varying hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In glancing arch, beneath the sunbeams flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dire was the strife, when ardent Teucapel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing in the front of carnage fell.                        <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once, Ongolmo, Elicura, rushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swaying their huge clubs together, crushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horseman and horse; then bathed their hands in gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And limb from limb the panting carcase tore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caupolican, where the main battle bleeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hosts and succeeding hosts undaunted leads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, torn and shattered by the ceaseless fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands, with gnashing teeth, and clenched spears, expire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced by a hundred wounds, Ongolmo lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grasps his club terrific as he dies.                       <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">With breathless expectation, on the height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro watched the long and dubious fight:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More close the holy image to his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now nearer to the fight Lautaro drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on the ground a warrior met his view,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A faint resemblance of his father's face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er him a horseman, with collected might,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the youth springing on, without a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snatched from a soldier's wearied grasp his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote the horseman through the crest: a yell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of triumph burst, as to the ground he fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><ins class="correction" title="Original was Lautora">Lautaro</ins> shouted, On! brave brothers, on!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And fainter now the Spanish shouts arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid ghastly heaps of many a bleeding corse,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">While still the rushing multitudes assail,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Spanish horsemen faint; long yells resound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the dragged ensign trails the gory ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shout, for the chief is seized!&mdash;a thousand cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst forth&mdash;Valdivia! for the sacrifice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, in silent dignity resigned,                            <span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meek Anselmo, led in bonds, behind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand upon his breast, young Zarinel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst a group of mangled Indians fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear that to his heart a passage found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left poor Olola's hair within the wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now all is hushed, save where, at times, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep midnight listens to a distant moan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where the condors clamour, overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strike with sounding beaks the helmets of the dead.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He is not here!&mdash;Say, does my father live?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wounded and weak the mountain chief appears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, live! Lautaro cried, with bursting tears,                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The warrior raised his look, and faintly smiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chili, my country, is avenged! he cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son!&mdash;then sunk upon a shield&mdash;and died.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lautaro knelt beside him, as he bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed his bleeding breast, and wept aloud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sounds of sadness through the circle ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus, with lifted axe, Caupolican:                         <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, for our fathers, brothers, children, slain,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Lautaro turned his eyes, and, gazing round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld Valdivia and Anselmo bound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One stood in arms, as with a stern despair,                     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">His eyebrows, dark and resolute, he bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood, composed, to wait the dire event.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still on the cross his looks Anselmo cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if all thought of this vain world was passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a world of light, without a shade,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where stood the Spanish chief, a muttering sound                <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose, and each club was lifted from the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, starting from his father's corse, his sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waving before his once-triumphant lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro cried, My breast shall meet the blow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But save&mdash;save him, to whom my life I owe!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Valdivia marked him with unmoving eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then looked upon his bonds, nor deigned reply;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Harratomac, stealing with slow pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifting high his iron-jagged mace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote him to earth; a thousand voices rose,                     <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled with shouts and yells, So fall our foes!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lautaro gave to tears a moment's space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As black in death he marked Valdivia's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cried&mdash;Chiefs, friends, and thou, Caupolican,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, spare this innocent and holy man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never sailed, rapacious, o'er the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold of blood-polluted lands to heap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never gave the armed hosts his aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But meekly to the Mighty Spirit prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in all lands the sounds of woe might cease,                <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brothers of the wide world dwell in peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor-youth saw generous sympathy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already steal to every warrior's eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus again: Oh, if this filial tear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If this uplifted arm, this bleeding steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak for my country what I felt and feel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, at this hour, I meet her high applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While my heart beats still ardent in her cause;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear, and forgive these tears that grateful flow,               <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! hear, how much to this poor man I owe!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I was a child&mdash;when to my sire's abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Chillan's vale, the armed horsemen rode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me, whilst my father cold and breathless lay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off the crested soldiers bore away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for a captive sold. No friend was near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mark a young and orphan stranger's tear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This humble man, with kind parental care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snatched me from slavery&mdash;saved from dark despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as my years increased, protected, fed,                      <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathed a father's blessings on my head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Spanish maid was with him: need I speak?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, affection's tear still wets my cheek!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years, as they passed, matured in ripening grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her form unfolding, and her beauteous face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heard my orphan tale; she loved to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes for my fortunes dropped a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could have bowed to direst ills resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wept at looks so sweet, at words so kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Valdivia saw me, now in blooming age,                        <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And claimed me from the father as his page;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chief too cherished me, yea, saved my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in Peru arose the civil strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still remembering her I loved so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft I returned to the gray father's cell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice instructed me; recalled my youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rude idolatry to heavenly truth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this hereafter; he my darkling mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleared, and from low and sensual thoughts refined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first, with feelings new impressed, I strove              <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide the tear of tenderness and love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the fairest maidens of Peru,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My eyes, my heart, one only object knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lived that object's love and faith to share;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, and blessed us with a father's prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here, at Valdivia's last and stern command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came, a stranger in my native land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anselmo (so him call&mdash;now most in need&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And standing here in bonds, for whom I plead)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came, by our chief so summoned, and for aid                    <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Great Spirit of the Christians prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here as a son I loved him, but I left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wife, a child, of my fond cares bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to see again; for death awaits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My entrance now in Lima's jealous gates.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Caupolican, didst thou thy father love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did his last dying look affection move?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity this aged man; unbend thy brow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was my father&mdash;is my father, now!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Consenting mercy marks each warrior's mien.                  <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who is this, what pallid form is seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As crushed already by the fatal blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound, and with looks white as a wreath of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hands upon her breast, scarce drawn her breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Spanish woman knelt, expecting death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst, borne by a dark warrior at her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An infant shrunk from the red plumes, and cried!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro started:<br /></span>
<span class="i19">Injured maid of Spain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me!&mdash;me! oh, take me to thine arms again!                      <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heard his voice, and, by the scene oppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one faint sigh fell senseless on his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Caupolican, with warm emotion, cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, live! Lautaro and his beauteous bride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, aged father!&mdash;and forthwith commands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior to unbind Anselmo's hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She raised her head: his eyes first met her view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As round Lautaro's neck her arms she threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, no! she feebly spoke; it is not true!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is some form of the distempered brain!                      <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hid her face upon his breast again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dark flashing eyes, terrific, glared around:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, his brains scattered by the deadly wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spanish chief lay on the gory ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lowering brows, and mace yet drooping blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clotted hair, there Mariantu stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anselmo here, sad, yet in sorrow mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared: she cried, A blessing on your child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knelt, as slow revived her waking sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, with looks aghast, Oh bear us hence!                 <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now all the assembled chiefs, assenting, cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, live! Lautaro and his beauteous bride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eager arms Lautaro snatched his boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed him in an agony of joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to Anselmo gave, who strove to speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt the tear first burning on his cheek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The infant held his neck with strict embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed his pale emaciated face.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the dread scene, wet with Valdivia's gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wan and trembling charge Lautaro bore.                     <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a bank, where slept the summer-light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A small stream whispering went in mazes bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stealing from the sea, the western wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waved the magnolias on the slope inclined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woodpecker, in glittering plumage green,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lautaro bent, with looks of love and joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er his yet trembling wife and beauteous boy:                 <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, by what miracle, beloved! say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou escaped the perils of the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Lima, where our humble dwelling stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these tumultuous scenes, this vale of blood?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roused by his voice, as from the sleep of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint she replied, with slow-recovering breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall express, when thou, best friend! wert gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sunk my heart!&mdash;deserted and alone!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">At length resolved, I sought thee o'er the seas:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brave bark cheer'ly went before the breeze,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From Lima bound to Chili's southern shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seized the fair occasion&mdash;ocean smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to the sire I bore his lisping child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm arose: with loud and sudden shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vessel sunk, disparting on a rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some mariners, amidst the billows wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce saved, in one small boat, me and my child.              <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I have borne, a captive since that day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive these tears&mdash;I scarce have heart to say!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None pitied, save one gentle Indian maid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wild maid&mdash;of her looks I was afraid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her long black hair upon her shoulders fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her hand she bore a wreathed shell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lautaro for a moment turned aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, Oh, my sister! with faint voice he cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Already free from sorrow and alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I clasped in thought a husband in my arms,                     <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a dark warrior, stationed on the height,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Exclaimed: No further, on thy life, advance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint, wearied, sinking to the earth with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the dismal cave my steps he led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only at eve, within the craggy cleft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some water, and a cake of maize, were left.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thirteenth sun unseen went down the sky;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Friend of my infant days, how I rejoice,                     <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro cried, once more to hear that voice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life like a dream, since last we met, has fled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, my beloved sister, thou art dead!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">INDIAN.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I come to guide thee through untrodden ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the lone valley, where thy father's days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were passed; where every cave and every tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From morn to morn, reminded him of thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lautaro cried: Here, faithful Indian, stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a last sad duty yet to pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little while we part:&mdash;thou here remain.                     <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake, and passed like lightning o'er the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, cease, Castilian maid, thy vain alarms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See where he comes&mdash;his father in his arms!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now lead, he cried. The Indian, sad and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paced on from wood to vale, from vale to hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her infant tired, and hushed a while to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiled, in a dream, upon its mother's breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pensive mother gray Anselmo led;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind, Lautaro bore his father dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath the branching palms they slept at night;             <span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The small birds waked them ere the morning light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their path, in distant view, appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain-smoke, that its dark column reared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Andes' summits, in the pale blue sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting their icy pinnacles so high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four days they onward held their eastern way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the fifth rising morn, before them lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chillan's lone glen, amid whose windings green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Warrior's loved and last abode was seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No smoke went up, a stillness reigned around,                  <span class="linenum">270</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where the waters fell with soothing sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where the Thenca sang so loud and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bright humming-bird was spinning near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet here all human tumults seemed to cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sunshine rested on the spot of peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The myrtles bloomed as fragrant and as green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if Lautaro scarce had left the scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his ear the falling waters' spray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed swelling with the sounds of yesterday.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where yonder rock the aged cedars shade,                     <span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shall my father's bones in peace be laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath the cedar's shade they dug the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The small and sad communion gathered round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the grave stood aged Izdabel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broke the spear, and cried: Farewell, farewell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lautaro hid his face, and sighed Adieu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the stone hatchet in the grave he threw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little child that to its mother clung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched out its arm, then on her garment hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sidelong looks, half-shrinking, half-amazed,              <span class="linenum">290</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dropped its flowers, unconscious, as it gazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now Anselmo, his pale brow inclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The honoured relics, dust to dust, consigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Christian rites, and sung, on bending knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Eternam pacem dona, Domine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rising up he closed the holy book;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifting in the beam his lighted look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The cross, with meekness, folded on his breast),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, too, he cried, my bones in peace shall rest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few years remain to me, and never more                         <span class="linenum">300</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I behold, O Spain! thy distant shore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here lay my bones, that the same tree may wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the poor Christian's and the Indian's grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, may it (when the sons of future days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hear our tale and on the hillock gaze),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, may it teach, that charity should bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er they roam, the brothers of mankind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time shall come, when wildest tribes shall hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy voice, O Christ! and drop the slaughtering spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet we condemn not him who bravely stood,                    <span class="linenum">310</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seal his country's freedom with his blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if, in after-times, a ruthless band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fell invaders sweep my native land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May she, by Chili's stern example led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurl back his thunder on the assailant's head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustained by Freedom, strike the avenging blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn one virtue from her ancient foe!<br /></span>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
